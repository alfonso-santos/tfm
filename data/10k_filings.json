BUSINESS Overview Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to &#8220;Battalion,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8221; refer to Battalion Oil Corporation and its subsidiaries, as a common entity. Battalion is the successor reporting company to Halc&#243;n Resources Corporation (Halc&#243;n). On January 21, 2020, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to effect a change of our corporate name from Halc&#243;n Resources Corporation to Battalion Oil Corporation. Certain prior year financial statements are not comparable to our current year financial statements due to the adoption of fresh&#8209;start accounting. References to &#8220;Successor&#8221; or &#8220;Successor Company&#8221; relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to October 1, 2019. References to &#8220;Predecessor&#8221; or &#8220;Predecessor Company&#8221; relate to the financial position and results of operations of the Company prior to, and including, &#160; October 1, 2019. We are an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, production, exploration and development of onshore liquids&#8209;rich oil and natural gas assets in the United States. During 2017 (Predecessor), we acquired certain properties in the Delaware Basin and divested our assets located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota (the Williston Divestiture) and in the El Halc&#243;n area of East Texas (the El Halc&#243;n Divestiture). As a result, our properties and drilling activities are currently focused in the Delaware Basin, where we have an extensive drilling inventory that we believe offers attractive economics. At December 31, 2019 (Successor), our estimated total proved oil and natural gas reserves, as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firm, Netherland, Sewell &#38; Associates, Inc. (Netherland, Sewell) using the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prices for crude oil and natural gas, which are based on the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil spot price of $55.85 per Bbl and Henry Hub natural gas spot price of $2.578 per MMBtu, were approximately 62.1 MMBoe, consisting of 39.2 MMBbls of oil, 10.8 MMBbls of natural gas liquids, and 72.3 Bcf of natural gas. Approximately 61% of our estimated proved reserves were classified as proved developed as of December 31, 2019 (Successor). We maintain operational control of approximately 99% of our estimated proved reserves. Our total operating revenues for the period of October 2, 2019 through December 31, 2019 (Successor) and the period of January 1, 2019 through October 1, 2019 (Predecessor) were approximately $65.6 million and $159.1 million, respectively, or $224.7 million combined, compared to total operating revenues for 2018 (Predecessor) of $226.6 million. During the period of October 2, 2019 through December 31, 2019 (Successor) and the period of January 1, 2019 through October 1, 2019 (Predecessor), production averaged 20,293 Boe\/d and 17,209 Boe\/d, respectively, or 17,986 Boe\/d combined, compared to average daily production of 13,904 Boe\/d during 2018 (Predecessor). Our average daily oil and natural gas production increased year over year due to the acquisition of properties in West Quito Draw and our drilling activities in Monument Draw and West Quito Draw. In 2019 (for the combined Successor and Predecessor periods), we drilled and cased 14 gross (12.5 net) operated wells, completed 17 gross (15.9 net) operated wells, and put online 17 gross (15.9 net) operated wells. Recent Developments Listing of our Common Stock on NYSE American Our Predecessor common stock was previously listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol &#8220;HK.&#8221; As a result of our failure to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NYSE, on July 22, 2019, our Predecessor common stock was delisted from the NYSE. Effective February 20, 2020, we commenced trading on the NYSE American exchange under the symbol &#8220;BATL.&#8221; Reorganization On August 2, 2019, we entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the Restructuring Support Agreement) with certain holders of our 6.75% senior unsecured notes due 2025 (the Unsecured Senior Noteholders). On August 7, 2019, we filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the Bankruptcy Court) to effect a prepackaged plan of reorganization (the Plan) as contemplated in the Restructuring Support Agreement. Our chapter 11 proceedings were administered under the caption In re Halc&#243;n Resources Corporation, et al. &#160;(Case No. 19-34446). On September 24, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan and on October 8, 2019 (the Effective Date), we emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy. Although we are not a debtor-in-possession, the Predecessor Company was a debtor-in-possession between August 7, 2019 and October 8, 2019. As such, certain aspects of the chapter 11 proceedings and related matters are summarized below to provide context to our financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. Pursuant to the terms of the Plan contemplated by the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Unsecured Senior Noteholders and other claim and interest holders received the following treatment in full and final satisfaction of their claims and interests: &#183; borrowings outstanding under the Predecessor Credit Agreement, plus unpaid interest and fees, were repaid in full, in cash, including by a refinancing (see below for further details regarding the credit agreement); &#183; the Unsecured Senior Noteholders received their pro rata share of 91% of the common stock of reorganized Battalion (New Common Shares), subject to dilution, issued pursuant to the Plan and participated in the Senior Noteholder Rights Offering (defined below); &#183; our general unsecured claims were unimpaired and paid in full in the ordinary course; and &#183; all of our Predecessor Company&#8217;s outstanding shares of common stock were cancelled and the existing common stockholders received their pro rata share of 9% of the New Common Shares issued pursuant to the Plan, subject to dilution, together with Warrants (defined below) to purchase common stock of reorganized Battalion and participated in the Existing Equity Interests Rights Offering (defined below and, collectively, the Existing Equity Total Consideration); provided, however, that registered holders of existing common stock with 2,000 shares or fewer of common stock received cash in an amount equal to the inherent value of such holder&#8217;s pro rata share of the Existing Equity Total Consideration (the Existing Equity Cash Out). Each of the foregoing percentages of equity in the reorganized Company were as of October 8, 2019 and are subject to dilution by New Common Shares issued in connection with (i) a management incentive plan, (ii) the Warrants (defined below), (iii) the Equity Rights Offerings (defined below), and (iv) the Backstop Commitment Premium (defined below). As a component of the Restructuring Support Agreement (i) certain Unsecured Senior Noteholders purchased their pro rata share of New Common Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $150.2 million (the Senior Noteholder Rights Offering) and (ii) certain existing common stockholders purchased their pro rata share of New Common Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $5.8 million (the Existing Equity Interests Rights Offering, and together with the Senior Noteholder Rights Offering, the Equity Rights Offerings), in each case, at a price per share equal to a 26% discount to the value of the New Common Shares based on an assumed total enterprise value of $425.0 million. Certain of the Unsecured Senior Noteholders backstopped the Senior Noteholder Rights Offering and received as consideration (the Backstop Commitment Premium) New Common Shares equal to 6% of the aggregate amount of the Senior Noteholder Rights Offering subject to dilution by New Common Shares issued in connection with a management incentive plan and the Warrants. If the backstop agreement had been terminated, we would have been obligated to make a cash payment equal to 6% of the aggregate amount of the Senior Noteholder Rights Offering. We used the proceeds of the Equity Rights Offerings to (i) provide additional liquidity for working capital and general corporate purposes, (ii) pay reasonable and documented restructuring expenses, and (iii) fund Plan distributions. Under the Restructuring Support Agreement, the existing common stockholders (subject to the Existing Equity Cash Out) were issued a series of warrants exercisable for cash for a three year period subsequent to the effective date of the Plan (Warrants). The Warrants were issued with strike prices based upon stipulated rate-of-return levels achieved by the Unsecured Senior Noteholders. The Warrants cumulatively represent 30% of the New Common Shares issued pursuant to the Plan. Fresh-start Accounting Upon emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy, we adopted fresh-start accounting in accordance with the provisions set forth in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 852, Reorganizations , as (i) the reorganization value of our assets immediately prior to the date of confirmation was less than the post-petition liabilities and allowed claims, and (ii) the holders of the existing voting shares of the Predecessor entity received less than 50% of the voting shares of the emerging entity. We elected to adopt fresh-start accounting effective October 1, 2019, to coincide with the timing of our normal fourth quarter reporting period, which resulted in us becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. We evaluated and concluded that events between October 1, 2019 and October 8, 2019 were immaterial and use of an accounting convenience date of October 1, 2019 was appropriate. As such, fresh-start accounting is reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 (Successor) and related fresh-start adjustments are included in the accompanying statement of operations for the period from January 1, 2019 through October 1, 2019 (Predecessor). Adopting fresh-start accounting results in a new financial reporting entity with no beginning or ending retained earnings or deficit balances as of the fresh-start reporting date. Upon the adoption of fresh-start accounting, our assets and liabilities were recorded at their fair values as of the fresh-start reporting date. Our adoption of fresh-start accounting may materially affect our results of operations following the fresh-start reporting date, as we have a new basis in our assets and liabilities. As a result of the adoption of fresh-start reporting and the effects of the implementation of the Plan, our consolidated financial statements subsequent to October 1, 2019 are not comparable to our consolidated financial statements prior to October 1, 2019. References to &#8220;Successor&#8221; or &#8220;Successor Company&#8221; relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to October 1, 2019. References to &#8220;Predecessor&#8221; or &#8220;Predecessor Company&#8221; relate to the financial position and results of operations of us prior to, and including, October 1, 2019, and as such, &#8220;black-line&#8221; financial statements are presented to distinguish between the Predecessor and Successor companies. Refer to Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 3, &#8220;Fresh-Start Accounting,&#8221; for further details. Common Stock On the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, all shares of our Predecessor Company were cancelled and we filed an amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State and adopted amended and restated bylaws. Pursuant to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the number of authorized shares of common stock which we have the authority to issue was reduced from 1,001,000,000 to 101,000,000. Of the 101,000,000 authorized shares, 100,000,000 are common stock, par value $0.0001 per share and 1,000,000 are preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. On the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of the Plan and the confirmation order, we issued: &#183; 421,827 shares of New Common Shares pursuant to the Existing Equity Interests Rights Offering; 8,059,111 shares of New Common Shares pursuant to the Senior Noteholder Rights Offering; and 3,558,334 shares of New Common Shares in connection with the backstop commitment, which includes 657,590 shares of New Common Shares issued as the Backstop Commitment Premium; &#183; 3,790,247 shares of New Common Shares to the Senior Noteholders pursuant to a mandatory exchange; and &#183; 374,421 shares of New Common Shares, 1,798,322 Series A Warrants (defined below), 2,247,985 Series B Warrants (defined below) and 2,890,271 Series C Warrants (defined below), to pre-emergence holders of our Existing Equity Interests pursuant to a mandatory exchange. Warrant Agreement On the Effective Date, by operation of the Plan and the confirmation order, all warrants of our Predecessor Company were cancelled and we entered into a warrant agreement (the Warrant Agreement) with Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc. as the warrant agent, pursuant to which we issued three series of warrants (the Series A Warrants, the Series B Warrants and the Series C Warrants and together, the Warrants, and the holders thereof, the Warrant Holders), on a pro rata basis to pre-emergence holders of our Existing Equity Interests pursuant to the Plan. Each Warrant represents the right to purchase one share of New Common Shares at the applicable exercise price, subject to adjustment as provided in the Warrant Agreement and as summarized below. On the Effective Date, we issued (i) Series A Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,798,322 shares of New Common Stock, with an initial exercise price of $40.17 per share, (ii) Series B Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,247,985 shares of New Common Stock, with an initial exercise price of $48.28 per share and (iii) Series C Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,890,271 shares of New Common Stock, with an initial exercise price of $60.45 per share. Each series of Warrants issued under the Warrant Agreement has a three-year term, expiring on October 8, 2022. The strike price of each series of Warrants issued under the Warrant Agreement increases monthly at an annualized rate of 6.75%, compounding monthly, as provided in the Warrant Agreement. The Warrants do not grant the Warrant Holder any voting or control rights or dividend rights, or contain any negative covenants restricting the operation of our business. Registration Rights Agreement On the Effective Date, we and the other signatories thereto (the Demand Stockholders), entered into a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement), pursuant to which, subject to certain conditions and limitations, we agreed to file with the SEC a registration statement concerning the resale of the registrable shares of our New Common Shares held by Demand Stockholders (the Registrable Securities), as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event later than the later to occur of (i) ninety (90) days after the Effective Date and (ii) a date specified by a written notice to us by Demand Stockholders holding at least a majority of the Registerable Securities, and thereafter to use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable. In addition, from time to time, the Demand Stockholders may request that additional Registrable Securities be registered for resale by us. Subject to certain limitations, the Demand Stockholders also have the right to request that we facilitate the resale of Registrable Securities pursuant to firm commitment underwritten public offerings. The Registration Rights Agreement contains other customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, provisions with respect to suspensions of our registration obligations and indemnification. Successor Senior Revolving Credit Facility On the Effective Date, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement, as amended on November 21, 2019, (the Senior Credit Agreement) with Bank of Montreal, as administrative agent, and certain other financial institutions party thereto, as lenders, which refinanced the DIP Facility and the Predecessor Credit Agreement, both of which are discussed below. The Senior Credit Agreement provides for a $750.0 million senior secured reserve-based revolving credit facility with a current borrowing base of $240.0 million. A portion of the Senior Credit Agreement, in the amount of $50.0 million, is available for the issuance of letters of credit. The maturity date of the Senior Credit Agreement is October 8, 2024. The first redetermination will be in the spring of 2020 and redeterminations will occur semi-annually thereafter, with us and the lenders each having the right to one interim unscheduled redetermination between any two consecutive semi-annual redeterminations. The borrowing base takes into account the estimated value of our oil and natural gas properties, proved reserves, total indebtedness, and other relevant factors consistent with customary oil and natural gas lending criteria. Amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Agreement bear interest at specified margins over the base rate of 1.00% to 2.00% for ABR-based loans or at specified margins over LIBOR of 2.00% to 3.00% for Eurodollar-based loans, which margins may be increased one-time by not more than 50 basis points per annum if necessary in order to successfully syndicate the Senior Credit Agreement, which is currently in process. These margins fluctuate based on our utilization of the facility. We may elect, at our option, to prepay any borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Agreement without premium or penalty, except with respect to any break funding payments which may be payable pursuant to the terms of the Senior Credit Agreement. We may be required to make mandatory prepayments of the outstanding borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement in connection with certain borrowing base deficiencies, including deficiencies which may arise in connection with a borrowing base redetermination, an asset disposition or swap terminations attributable in the aggregate to more than ten percent (10%) of the then-effective borrowing base. Amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our direct and indirect subsidiaries and secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries. The Senior Credit Agreement contains certain events of default, including non-payment; breaches of representations and warranties; non-compliance with covenants; cross-defaults to material indebtedness; voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy; adverse judgments and change in control. The Senior Credit Agreement also contains certain financial covenants, including maintenance of (i) a Total Net Indebtedness Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00 and (ii) a Current Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.00:1.00, both commencing with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2020. On November 21, 2019 (Successor), we entered into the First Amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement which, among other things, (i) reduced the borrowing base to $240.0 million and (ii) limited the Total Net Indebtedness Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2020, of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00. Debtor-in-Possession Financing In connection with the chapter 11 proceedings and pursuant to an order of the Bankruptcy Court dated August 9, 2019 (the Interim Order), we entered into a Junior Secured Debtor-In-Possession Credit Agreement (the DIP Credit Agreement) with the Unsecured Senior Noteholders party thereto from time to time as lenders (the DIP Lenders) and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as administrative agent. Under the DIP Credit Agreement, the DIP Lenders made available a $35.0 million debtor-in-possession junior secured term credit facility (the DIP Facility), of which $25.0 million was extended as an initial loan and the remainder of which was drawn on September 5, 2019 (Predecessor). The DIP Facility was refinanced with the Senior Credit Agreement on October 8, 2019 (Successor). We used the proceeds of the DIP Facility to, among other things, (i) provide working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to finance capital expenditures and make certain interest payments as and to the extent set forth in the Interim Order and\/or the final order, as applicable, of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with our budget delivered pursuant to the DIP Credit Agreement, (ii) pay fees and expenses related to the transactions contemplated by the DIP Credit Agreement in accordance with such budget and (iii) cash collateralize any letters of credit. The DIP Loans bore interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 5.50% or (ii) an alternative base rate plus an applicable margin of 4.50%, in each case, as selected by us. The DIP Facility was secured by (i) a junior secured perfected security interest on all assets that secured the Predecessor Credit Agreement and (ii) a senior secured perfected security interest on all our unencumbered assets and any subsidiary guarantors. The security interests and liens were further subject to certain carve-outs and permitted liens, as set forth in the DIP Credit Agreement. The DIP Credit Agreement contained certain customary (i) representations and warranties; (ii) affirmative and negative covenants, including delivery of financial statements; conduct of business; reserve reports; title information; indebtedness; liens; dividends and distributions; investments; sale or discount of receivables; mergers; sale of properties; termination of swap agreements; transactions with affiliates; negative pledges; dividend restrictions; gas imbalances; take-or-pay or other prepayments and swap agreements; and (iii) events of default, including non-payment; breaches of representations and warranties; non-compliance with covenants or other agreements; cross-default to material indebtedness; judgments; change of control; dismissal (or conversion to chapter 7) of the chapter 11 proceedings; and failure to satisfy certain bankruptcy milestones. Predecessor Senior Revolving Credit Facility On October 8, 2019 (Successor), borrowings outstanding under the Predecessor Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the Predecessor Credit Agreement) were repaid and refinanced with proceeds from the Equity Rights Offerings and borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement. On May 9, 2019 (Predecessor), we entered into the Eighth Amendment, Consent and Waiver to Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement (the Eighth Amendment) which, among other things, (i) temporarily waived any default or event of default directly resulting from the potential Leverage Ratio Default (as defined in the Eighth Amendment) for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2019, (ii) increased interest margins to 1.75% to 2.75% for ABR-based loans and 2.75% to 3.75% for Eurodollar-based loans, (iii) reduced our Consolidated Cash Balance (as defined in the Eighth Amendment) to $5.0 million, and (iv) provided for periodic reporting of projected cash flows and accounts payable agings to the lenders. Under the Eighth Amendment, the waiver would have terminated and an Event of Default (as defined in the Predecessor Credit Agreement) would have occurred on August 1, 2019. On July 31, 2019 (Predecessor), we entered into the Waiver to Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement, pursuant to which the termination date for the waiver granted by the Eighth Amendment was extended to August 8, 2019. 2020 Capital Budget Our 2020 drilling and completion budget, approved by our board in December 2019, contemplated running one operated rig in the Delaware Basin during the year. That budget contemplated spending approximately $123 million to $138 million in capital expenditures, including drilling, completion, support infrastructure and other capital costs, to drill seven to ten gross operated wells and to put online 12 to 14 gross operated wells during the year. We continuously monitor changes in market conditions and adapt our operational plans as necessary in order to maintain financial flexibility, preserve acreage, and meet our contractual obligations. As a result of recent changes in market conditions and commodity prices, we are considering revisions to our 2020 capital budget which would lower anticipated capital expenditures to approximately $60 million to $76 million and include drilling four to six gross operated wells and putting online six to seven gross operated wells during the year. We expect to fund our budgeted 2020 capital expenditures with cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Senior Credit Agreement. In the event our cash flows are materially less than anticipated and other sources of capital we historically have utilized are not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to curtail drilling, development, land acquisitions and other activities to reduce our capital spending. Our financial results depend upon many factors, but are largely driven by the volume of our oil and natural gas production and the price that we receive for that production. Our production volumes will decline as reserves are depleted unless we expend capital in successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties with existing production. The amount we realize for our production depends predominately upon commodity prices, which are affected by changes in market demand and supply, as impacted by overall economic activity, weather, transportation take-away capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. Accordingly, finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs is critical to our long-term success. Business Strategy Our primary long&#8209;term objective is to increase stockholder value by safely and cost&#8209;effectively increasing our production of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, adding to our proved reserves and growing our inventory of economic drilling locations, while acting as a responsible corporate citizen in the areas in which we operate. To accomplish this objective, we intend to execute the following business strategies: &#183; Develop our Liquids-Rich Acreage Positions to Grow Production and Reserves Efficiently. We intend to drill and develop our multi-zone resource play to maximize value and resource potential. Our near-term development plans are focused on production growth and acreage preservation in our liquids-rich Monument Draw area. &#183; Enhance Returns Through Continued Improvements in Operational and Cost Efficiencies. We are the operator for the majority of our acreage, which gives us control over the timing of capital expenditures, execution and costs. It also allows us to adjust our capital spending based on drilling results and the economic environment. As operator, we are able to evaluate industry drilling results and implement improved operating practices that may enhance our initial production rates, ultimate recovery factors and rate of return on invested capital. In addition to operational efficiencies, we continue to implement cost-saving measures to reduce corporate administrative expenses. &#183; Maintain Strong Balance Sheet and Financial Flexibility. Our management team is focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, which we intend to achieve through conservative use of leverage and continued improvements on rates of return. We believe our internally-generated cash flows and borrowing capacity under our Senior Credit Agreement will provide us with sufficient liquidity to execute our current capital program and strategy. We have no near-term debt maturities. We also employ a hedging program to reduce the variability of our cash flows used to support our capital spending. &#183; Attain Growth Through Strategic Business Combinations. We intend to pursue merger and acquisition opportunities to meet our strategic and financial targets, including the maintenance of a conservative leverage position. Selective business combinations provide opportunities to acquire high quality assets complementary to our core acreage, expand our drilling inventory and gain operational scale. Our management team&#8217;s geologic and engineering expertise, particularly in the Permian Basin, provides a competitive advantage in the identification of acquisition targets and evaluation of resource potential. Oil and Natural Gas Reserves The proved reserves estimates reported herein for the years ended December 31, 2019 (Successor), 2018 (Predecessor) and 2017 (Predecessor) have been independently evaluated by Netherland, Sewell, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies. Netherland, Sewell was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F&#8209;2699. Within Netherland, Sewell, the technical persons primarily responsible for preparing the estimates set forth in the Netherland, Sewell reserves reports incorporated herein are Mr. Neil H. Little and Mr. Mike K. Norton. Mr. Little, a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (No. 117966), has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at Netherland, Sewell since 2011 and has over nine years of prior industry experience. He graduated from Rice University in 2002 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Chemical Engineering and from University of Houston in 2007 with a Master of Business Administration Degree. Mr. Norton, a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas (No. 441), has been a practicing petroleum geoscience consultant at Netherland, Sewell since 1989 and has over 10 years of prior industry experience. He graduated from Texas A&#38;M University in 1978 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Geology. Netherland, Sewell has reported to us that both technical principals meet or exceed the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers; they are both proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines. Our board of directors has established a reserves committee composed of independent directors with experience in energy company reserve evaluations. Our independent engineering firm reports jointly to the reserves committee and to our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. The reserves committee is charged with ensuring the integrity of the process of selection and engagement of the independent engineering firm and in making a recommendation to our board of directors as to whether to approve the report prepared by our independent engineering firm. Mr. Daniel P. Rohling, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the annual reserve report by Netherland, Sewell. He has more than 14 years of oil and gas operations experience and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas A&#38;M University and is an active member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The reserves information in this Annual Report on Form 10&#8209;K represents only estimates. Reserve evaluation is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers may vary significantly. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may lead to revising the original estimate. Accordingly, initial reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. The meaningfulness of such estimates depends primarily on the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. Except to the extent we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities or both, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced. For additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves, the preparation of such estimates by Netherland, Sewell and other information about our oil and natural gas reserves, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8212;&#8220; Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited) .&#8221; Proved reserve estimates are based on the unweighted arithmetic average prices on the first day of each month for the 12&#8209;month period ended December 31, 2019 (Successor). Average prices for the 12&#8209;month period were as follows: WTI crude oil spot price of $55.85 per Bbl, adjusted by lease or field for quality, transportation fees, and market differentials and a Henry Hub natural gas spot price of $2.578 per MMBtu, as adjusted by lease or field for energy content, transportation fees, and market differentials. All prices and costs associated with operating wells were held constant in accordance with SEC guidelines. The following table presents certain proved reserve information as of December 31, 2019 (Successor). &#160; &#160; &#160; Proved Reserves (MBoe) (1) &#160; &#160; Developed &#160; 37,935 Undeveloped &#160; 24,118 Total &#160; 62,053 (1) Natural gas reserves are converted to oil reserves using a ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl of oil. This ratio is based on energy equivalency, not price equivalency. The price for a barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas is substantially lower than the price for a barrel of oil. The following table sets forth the number of productive oil and natural gas wells in which we owned an interest as of December 31, 2019 (Successor) and 2018 (Predecessor). Shut&#8209;in wells currently not capable of production are excluded from the well information below. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Years Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross &#160; Net &#160; Gross &#160; Net Oil &#160; &#160; 94.1 &#160; &#160; 87.1 Natural Gas &#160; &#160; 7.7 &#160; &#160; 9.5 Total &#160; &#160; 101.8 &#160; &#160; 96.6 &#160; Oil and Natural Gas Production During 2017 (Predecessor), we divested our assets located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota and in the El Halc&#243;n area of East Texas, which represented substantially all of our proved reserves and production at the time, and we acquired certain properties in the Delaware Basin. As a consequence, our estimated proved reserves, oil and natural gas production and anticipated capital expenditures are currently focused entirely in this core area. Core Resource Play&#8212;Delaware Basin We have working interests in approximately 52,368 net acres in the Delaware Basin as of December 31, 2019 (Successor) in Pecos, Reeves, Ward and Winkler Counties, Texas. This core resource play is characterized by high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content in thick, continuous sections of source rock that can provide repeatable drilling opportunities and significant initial production rates. Our primary targets in this area are the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring formations. As of December 31, 2019 (Successor), we had approximately 120 operated wells producing in this area in addition to minor working interests in 19 non-operated wells. Our average daily net production from this area for the year ended December 31, 2019 (for the combined Successor and Predecessor periods) was approximately 17,950 Boe\/d. As of December 31, 2019 (Successor), estimated proved reserves for the Delaware Basin were approximately 62.0 MMBoe, of which approximately 61% were classified as proved developed and approximately 39% as proved undeveloped. Risk Management We have designed a risk management policy for the use of derivative instruments to provide partial protection against certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations, such as commodity price declines and price differentials between the NYMEX commodity price and the index price at the location where our production is sold. Derivative contracts are utilized to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations and reduce the variability in our cash flows associated with anticipated sales of future oil and natural gas production. Our objective generally is to hedge 75&#8209;85% of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next 24 to 36 months. However, our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. Our hedge policies and objectives change as our operational profile changes. Our future performance is subject to commodity price risks and our future cash flows from operations may be volatile. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative trading purposes. While there are many different types of derivatives available, we typically use fixed-price swap, costless collar, basis swap, and WTI NYMEX roll agreements to attempt to manage price risk. The fixed-price swap agreements call for payments to, or receipts from, counterparties depending on whether the index price of oil or natural gas for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the period contracted under the fixed-price swap agreement. Costless collar agreements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period. All costless collar agreements provide for payments to counterparties if the settlement price under the agreement exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the settlement price under the agreement is below the floor. Basis swaps effectively lock in a price differential between regional prices (i.e. Midland) where the product is sold and the relevant pricing index under which the oil production is hedged (i.e. Cushing). WTI NYMEX roll agreements account for pricing adjustments to the trade month versus the delivery month for contract pricing. It is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers. As of December 31, 2019 (Successor), we did not post collateral under any of our derivative contracts as they are secured under our Senior Credit Agreement or are uncollateralized trades. We will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212; Note 10 , &#8220;Derivative and Hedging Activities,&#8221; for additional information. Oil and Natural Gas Operations Our principal properties consist of leasehold interests in developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas properties and the reserves associated with these properties. Generally, our oil and natural gas leases remain in force as long as production in paying quantities is maintained. Leases on undeveloped oil and natural gas properties are typically for a primary term of three to five years within which we are generally required to develop the property or the lease will expire. In some cases, the primary term of leases on our undeveloped properties can be extended by option payments; the amount of any payments and time extended vary by lease. The table below sets forth the results of our drilling activities for the periods indicated: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Years Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross &#160; Net &#160; Gross &#160; Net &#160; Gross &#160; Net Exploratory Wells: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Productive (1) &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; Dry &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; Total Exploratory &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; Extension Wells: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Productive (1) &#160; &#160; 9.9 &#160; &#160; 12.5 &#160; &#160; 13.0 Dry &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; Total Extension &#160; &#160; 9.9 &#160; &#160; 12.5 &#160; &#160; 13.0 Development Wells: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Productive (1) &#160; &#160; 6.1 &#160; &#160; 15.0 &#160; &#160; 20.7 Dry &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; Total Development &#160; &#160; 6.1 &#160; &#160; 15.0 &#160; &#160; 20.7 Total Wells: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Productive (1) &#160; &#160; 16.0 &#160; &#160; 27.5 &#160; &#160; 33.7 Dry &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; Total &#160; &#160; 16.0 &#160; &#160; 27.5 &#160; &#160; 33.7 (1) Although a well may be classified as productive upon completion, future changes in oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and production may result in the well becoming uneconomical, particularly extension or exploratory wells where there is no production history. We own interests in developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas acreage in the locations set forth in the table below. These ownership interests generally take the form of working interests in oil and natural gas leases that have varying provisions. The following table presents a summary of our acreage interests as of December 31, 2019 (Successor): &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Developed Acreage &#160; Undeveloped Acreage &#160; Total Acreage State &#160; Gross &#160; Net &#160; Gross &#160; Net &#160; Gross &#160; Net North Dakota &#160; 3,510 &#160; &#160; 33,981 &#160; 13,945 &#160; 37,491 &#160; 14,639 Oklahoma &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Texas &#160; 35,087 &#160; 32,306 &#160; 25,187 &#160; 20,062 &#160; 60,274 &#160; 52,368 Total Acreage &#160; 38,597 &#160; 33,000 &#160; 59,555 &#160; 34,144 &#160; 98,152 &#160; 67,144 &#160; The table below reflects the percentage of our total net undeveloped acreage as of December 31, 2019 (Successor) that will expire each year if we do not establish production in paying quantities on the units in which such acreage is included or do not pay (to the extent we have the contractual right to pay) delay rentals or obtain other extensions to maintain the lease. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Year &#160; Percentage Expiration &#160; % &#160; % &#160; % 2023 &#38; beyond &#160; % &#160; &#160; % &#160; For our proved undeveloped locations that are not scheduled to be drilled until after lease expiration, we continually review our near&#8209;term lease expirations to determine which lease extensions and renewals to actively pursue, and modify our drilling schedules in order to preserve the leases. We have no current plans to drill on acreage in areas outside of our core area of operations. At December 31, 2019 (Successor), we had estimated proved reserves of approximately 62.1 MMBoe comprised of 39.2 MMBbls of crude oil, 10.8 MMBbls of natural gas liquids, and 72.3 Bcf of natural gas. The following table sets forth, at December 31, 2019 (Successor), these reserves: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Proved &#160; Proved &#160; Total &#160; &#160; Developed &#160; Undeveloped &#160; Proved Oil (MBbls) &#160; 22,821 &#160; 16,413 &#160; 39,234 Natural Gas Liquids (MBbls) &#160; 7,021 &#160; 3,754 &#160; 10,775 Natural Gas (MMcf) &#160; 48,558 &#160; 23,703 &#160; 72,261 Equivalent (MBoe) (1) &#160; 37,935 &#160; 24,118 &#160; 62,053 (1) Natural gas reserves are converted to oil reserves using a ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl of oil. This ratio is based on energy equivalency, not price equivalency. The price for a barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas is substantially lower than the price for a barrel of oil. At December 31, 2019 (Successor), total estimated proved reserves were approximately 62.1 MMBoe, a 23.1 MMBoe net decrease from the previous year&#8217;s estimate of 85.2 MMBoe. The net decrease in total proved reserves was the result of negative revisions of 29.7 MMBoe and production of 6.6 MMBoe, partially offset by additions and extensions of 13.2 MMBoe. At December 31, 2019 (Successor), our estimated proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves were approximately 24.1 MMBoe, a 21.2 MMBoe net decrease from the previous year&#8217;s estimate of 45.3 MMBoe. The net decrease in total PUD reserves was the result of negative revisions of 21.4 MMBoe and development of 10.2 MMBoe, partially offset by additions and extensions of 10.4 MMBoe. As of December 31, 2019 (Successor), all of our PUD reserves are planned to be developed within five years from the date they were initially recorded. During 2019, approximately $76.1 million in capital expenditures went toward the development of proved undeveloped reserves, which includes drilling, completion and other facility costs associated with developing proved undeveloped wells. Reliable technologies were used to determine areas where PUD locations are more than one offset location away from a producing well. These technologies include seismic data, wire line openhole log data, core data, log cross&#8209;sections, performance data, and statistical analysis. In such areas, these data demonstrated consistent, continuous reservoir characteristics in addition to significant quantities of economic estimated ultimate recoveries from individual producing wells. We relied only on production flow tests and historical production data, along with the reliable geologic data mentioned above to estimate proved reserves. No other alternative methods or technologies were used to estimate proved reserves. Out of total proved undeveloped reserves of 24.1 MMBoe at December 31, 2019 (Successor), 4.9 MMBoe were associated with five gross PUD locations that were more than one offset location from a producing well. The estimates of quantities of proved reserves contained in this report were made in accordance with the definitions contained in SEC Release No. 33&#8209;8995, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting . For additional information on our oil and natural gas reserves, including a table detailing the changes by year of our proved reserves, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;&#8220;Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited).&#8221; We account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting in accordance with SEC regulations. Accordingly, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration, and development of proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, treating equipment and gathering support facilities, dry holes, geophysical costs, direct internal costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized. All general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred. Sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change. Depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on proved reserves.

This ratio is based on energy equivalency, not price equivalency. The price for a barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas is substantially lower than the price for a barrel of oil. (2) Cash paid on, or cash received from, settled derivative contracts are reflected as &#8220;Net gain (loss) on derivative contracts&#8221; in the consolidated statements of operations, consistent with our decision not to elect hedge accounting. Competitive Conditions in the Business The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive and we compete with a substantial number of other companies that have greater financial and other resources. Many of these companies explore for, produce and market oil and natural gas, as well as carry on refining operations and market the resultant products on a worldwide basis. The primary areas in which we encounter substantial competition are in locating and acquiring desirable leasehold acreage for our drilling and development operations, locating and acquiring attractive producing oil and natural gas properties, obtaining sufficient availability of drilling and completion equipment and services, obtaining purchasers and transporters of the oil and natural gas we produce and hiring and retaining key employees. There is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other industries producing energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and\/or regulation considered from time to time by the government of the United States and the states in which our properties are located. It is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. Other Business Matters Markets and Major Customers The purchasers of our oil and natural gas production consist primarily of independent marketers, major oil and natural gas companies and gas pipeline companies. Historically, we have not experienced any significant losses from uncollectible accounts. For the combined periods of October 2, 2019 through December 31, 2019 (Successor), and January 1, 2019 through October 1, 2019 (Predecessor), two individual purchasers of our production, Western Refining Inc. and Sunoco Inc., each accounted for more than 10% of total sales, collectively representing 80% of our total sales for the period. In 2018 (Predecessor), two individual purchasers of our production, Sunoco, Inc. and Western Refining, Inc., each accounted for more than 10% of total sales, collectively representing 77% of our total sales for the year. In 2017 (Predecessor), two individual purchasers of our production, Crestwood Midstream Partners and Suncor Energy Marketing, Inc., each accounted for more than 10% of total sales, collectively representing 58% of our total sales for the year. Seasonality of Business Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, oil and natural gas and can also delay drilling activities, disrupting our overall business plans. Demand for crude oil can often be higher in the summer months during the peak travel season. Demand for natural gas is typically higher during the winter, resulting in higher natural gas prices for our natural gas production during our first and fourth fiscal quarters. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, our results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that we may realize on an annual basis. Operational Risks Oil and natural gas exploration and development involves a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to be overcome. There is no assurance that we will discover or acquire additional oil and natural gas in commercial quantities. Oil and natural gas operations also involve the risk that well fires, blowouts, equipment failure, human error and other events may cause accidental releases of toxic or hazardous materials, such as hydrogen sulfide, petroleum liquids, or drilling fluids into the environment, or cause significant injury to persons or property. In such event, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the satisfaction of which could substantially reduce available cash and possibly result in loss of oil and natural gas properties. Such hazards may also cause damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and pipeline or other processing facilities. As is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position or cash flows. For further discussion on risks see Item 1A. Risk Factors . Regulations All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units, the density of wells that may be drilled in oil and natural gas properties and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of land and leases to facilitate exploration while other states rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of land and leases. In areas where pooling is primarily or exclusively voluntary, it may be difficult to form spacing units and therefore difficult to develop a project if the operator owns less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose specified requirements regarding the ratability of production. On some occasions, local authorities have imposed moratoria or other restrictions on exploration and production activities pending investigations and studies addressing potential local impacts of these activities before allowing oil and natural gas exploration and production to proceed. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. Environmental Regulations Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency, commonly referred to as the EPA, issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures. Among other things, environmental regulatory programs typically govern the permitting, construction and operation of a facility. Many factors, including public perception, can materially impact the ability to secure an environmental construction or operation permit. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which could result in liability for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on our part. Beyond existing requirements, new programs and changes in existing programs may address various aspects of our business, including naturally occurring radioactive materials, oil and natural gas exploration and production, air emissions, waste management, and underground injection of waste material. Environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. Hazardous Substances and Wastes The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons may include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances that have been released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of some health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. Under the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, referred to as RCRA, most wastes generated by the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are not regulated as hazardous waste. Periodically, however, there are proposals to lift the existing exemption for oil and gas wastes and reclassify them as hazardous wastes or to subject them to enhanced solid waste regulation. If such proposals were to be enacted, they could have a significant impact on our operating costs and on those of all the industry in general. In the ordinary course of our operations, moreover some wastes generated in connection with our exploration and production activities may be regulated as solid waste under RCRA, as hazardous waste under existing RCRA regulations or as hazardous substances under CERCLA. From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own or at which we have operations. Under CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, we have been and may be required to remove or remediate such materials or wastes. Water Discharges Our operations also may be subject to the federal Clean Water Act and analogous state statutes. Those laws regulate discharges of wastewater, oil, and other pollutants to surface water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, wetlands, and streams. Failure to obtain permits for such discharges could result in civil and criminal penalties, orders to cease such discharges, and costs to remediate and pay natural resources damages. These laws also require the preparation and implementation of spill prevention, control, and countermeasure plans in connection with on&#8209;site storage of significant quantities of oil. In the event of a discharge of oil into U.S. waters, we could be liable under the Oil Pollution Act for cleanup costs, damages and economic losses. Our oil and natural gas production also generates salt water, which we dispose of by underground injection. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), the Underground Injection Control (UIC) regulations promulgated under the SDWA, and related state programs regulate the drilling and operation of salt water disposal wells. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states, and in others it is delegated to the state. Permits must be obtained before drilling salt water disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring must be conducted periodically to ensure the casing is not leaking salt water to groundwater. Contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SDWA and state laws. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury. Hydraulic Fracturing Our completion operations are subject to regulation, which may increase in the short&#8209; or long&#8209;term. In particular, the well completion technique known as hydraulic fracturing, which is used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas, has come under increased scrutiny by the environmental community, and many local, state and federal regulators. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure, usually down casing that is cemented in the wellbore, into prospective rock formations at depths to stimulate oil and natural gas production. We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with substantially all of the wells for which we are the operator. Working at the direction of Congress, the EPA issued a study in 2016 finding that hydraulic fracturing could potentially harm drinking water resources under adverse circumstances such as injection directly into groundwater or into production wells lacking mechanical integrity. The EPA also promulgated pre&#8209;treatment standards under the Clean Water Act for wastewater discharges from shale hydraulic fracturing operations to municipal sewage treatment plants. Environmental groups have encouraged the EPA to supplement those requirements. Various members of Congress likewise have from time to time introduced bills that would result in more stringent control or outright bans of the hydraulic fracturing process. In addition, the Department of the Interior promulgated regulations concerning the use of hydraulic fracturing on lands under its jurisdiction, which includes lands on which we conduct or plan to conduct operations. While the Trump Administration rescinded those rules, that decision is being challenged in court. Regardless of how the federal issues are eventually resolved, states have been imposing new restrictions or bans on hydraulic fracturing. Even local jurisdictions, such as Denton, Texas and several cities in Colorado, have adopted, or tried to adopt, regulations restricting hydraulic fracturing. Additional hydraulic fracturing requirements at the federal, state or local level may limit our ability to operate or increase our operating costs. Air Emissions The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed and may continue to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources, including oil and natural gas production. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non&#8209;compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Our operations, or the operations of service companies engaged by us, may in certain circumstances and locations be subject to permits and restrictions under these statutes for emissions of air pollutants. In 2012 and 2016, the EPA issued air regulations for the oil and natural gas industry that address emissions from certain new sources of volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, air toxics, and methane. The rules included the first federal air standards for natural gas and oil wells that are hydraulically fractured, or refractured, as well as requirements for other processes and equipment, including storage tanks. Compliance with these regulations has imposed additional requirements and costs on our operations. The Trump Administration may rescind some of the 2012 and 2016 requirements, but supporters of the existing regulations likely would seek judicial review of any such decision. In October 2015, the EPA announced that it was lowering the primary national ambient air quality standard for ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. Implementation will take place over several years; however, the new standard could result in a significant expansion of ozone nonattainment areas across the United States, including areas in which we operate. Oil and natural gas operations in ozone nonattainment areas would likely be subject to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements, and increased permitting delays and costs. Climate Change Studies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. In response, governments increasingly have been adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that require reporting and reductions of the emission of such greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, are considered greenhouse gases. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement address greenhouse gas emissions, and several countries, including those comprising the European Union, have established greenhouse gas regulatory systems. In the United States, at the state level, many states, either individually or through multi&#8209;state regional initiatives, have been implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through emission inventories, emissions targets, greenhouse gas cap and trade programs or incentives for renewable energy generation, while others have considered adopting such greenhouse gas programs. At the federal level, the EPA has issued regulations requiring us and other companies to annually report certain greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas facilities. Beyond its measuring and reporting rules, the EPA has issued an &#8220;Endangerment Finding&#8221; under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The finding served as the first step in issuing regulations that require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities. In addition, the Obama Administration developed a Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions that was intended to result by 2025 in a 40&#8209;45% decrease in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry as compared to 2012 levels. Consistent with that strategy, the EPA issued air rules for oil and gas production sources, and the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) promulgated standards for reducing venting and flaring on public lands. The Trump Administration has been trying to roll back many of the Obama&#8209;era climate change policies and rules; however, the long&#8209;term direction of federal climate regulation is uncertain. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur additional operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems or other compliance costs, and reduce demand for our products. The National Environmental Policy Act Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. All of our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Threatened and endangered species, migratory birds, and natural resources Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Clean Water Act. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions on federal land use or on private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Where takings of or harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat, or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to prevent or restrict oil and gas exploration activities or seek damages for any injury, whether resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and in some cases, criminal penalties may result. Occupational Safety and Health Act We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration&#8217;s hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees. Employees and Principal Office As of December 31, 2019 (Successor), we had 69 full&#8209;time employees. We hire independent contractors on an as needed basis. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.

Business General Chemed Corporation (the Company or Chemed) was incorporated in Delaware in 1970 as a subsidiary of W.R. Grace &#38; Co. and succeeded to the business of W.R. Grace &#38; Co.&#8217;s Special Products Group as of April 30, 1971 and remained a subsidiary of W.R. Grace &#38; Co. until March 10, 1982. Chemed purchases, operates and divests subsidiaries engaged in diverse business activities for the purposes of maximizing shareholder value. The Company&#8217;s day to day operating businesses are managed on a decentralized basis. There are few integrated business functions between the operating units and Chemed (such as sales, marketing or purchasing). Chemed&#8217;s corporate office management participates in and is ultimately responsible for long term strategic planning, significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities, financial reporting, tax, legal and the selection of the key executives of each of the operating businesses. Since its inception, the Company has engaged in twelve significant acquisitions or divestitures of diverse business units. During 2019, Chemed conducted its business operations in two segments: the VITAS segment (VITAS) and the Roto-Rooter segment (Roto-Rooter). VITAS provides hospice and palliative care services to its patients through a network of physicians, registered nurses, home health aides, social workers, clergy and volunteers. Roto-Rooter provides plumbing, drain cleaning, excavation, water restoration and other related services to residential and commercial customers. Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report contains or incorporates by reference certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company intends such statements to be subject to the safe harbors created by that legislation. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Financial Information about Industry Segments The required segment and geographic data for the Company&#8217;s continuing operations (as described below) for three years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 are shown in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 63-64 of the 2019 Annual Report to Stockholders and are incorporated herein by reference. Description of Business by Segment The information called for by this item is included within Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on pages 63-64 of the 2019 Annual Report to Stockholders is incorporated herein by reference. Product and Market Development Each segment of the Company&#8217;s business analyzes opportunities for the development and marketing of new services and products. While new products and services and new market development are important factors for the long term growth of each active segment of the Company&#8217;s business, the Company does not expect that any new products and services or marketing effort, including those in the development stage, will require the investment of a material amount of the Company&#8217;s assets. Patents, Service Marks and Licenses The Roto-Rooter trademarks and service marks have been used and advertised since 1935 by Roto-Rooter Corporation, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company. The Roto-Rooter marks are among the most highly recognized trademarks and service marks in the United States. The Company considers the Roto-Rooter marks to be a valuable asset and a significant factor in the marketing of Roto-Rooter&#8217;s franchises, products and services and the products and services provided by its franchises. &#8220;VITAS&#8221; and &#8220;Innovative Hospice Care&#8221; are trademarks and servicemarks of VITAS Healthcare Corporation. The Company and its subsidiaries also own certain trade secrets including training manuals, cost information, patient information and software source code. Certain states require certificates of need to conduct hospice operations. In those states, we consider certificates of need valuable assets. &#160; &#160; Seasonality Roto-Rooter&#8217;s revenue and operating results are impacted by significant weather patterns across the United States. Significant changes in precipitation or temperatures in areas we have company-owned and independent contractor operations will generally affect the revenue and operating results at Roto-Rooter. A significant portion of our VITAS business is operated in the state of Florida. The vast majority of our patients are Medicare recipients. Medicare patients relocating to Florida during the winter months generally result in higher admissions and revenue for our Florida programs during that period. Customer Concentration Roto-Rooter&#8217;s business has a large and diverse customer base. Over 90% of VITAS&#8217; revenue is from the United States government through the Medicare program. The loss of a portion or all of our Medicare revenue would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Competition Roto-Rooter All aspects of the sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, plumbing repair, excavation and water restoration businesses are highly competitive. Competition is fragmented in most markets with local and regional firms providing the primary competition. The principal methods of competition are advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, emergency-service availability, speed and quality of customer service, service guarantees, and pricing. VITAS Hospice care in the United States is competitive. Plans of care for hospice services are not proprietary. As a result, VITAS competes and differentiates itself primarily on the basis of its ability to deliver quality, responsive services within the requirements of Medicare&#8217;s hospice conditions of participation. VITAS is one of the nation&#8217;s largest providers of hospice services in an industry dominated primarily by small, non-profit, community-based hospices. Approximately 25% of all hospice providers are not-for-profit. Because the hospice care industry is highly fragmented, VITAS competes with a large number of organizations. VITAS also competes with a number of national and regional hospice providers, hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies and other health care providers. Many providers offer home care to patients who are terminally ill, and some actively market palliative care and hospice-like programs. In addition, various health care companies have diversified into the hospice market. Some of these health care companies have greater financial resources than VITAS. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the majority of markets served by VITAS. Accordingly, other companies that are not currently providing hospice care may enter these markets and expand the variety of services they offer to include hospice. Research and Development The Company engages in a continuous program directed toward the development of new services, products and processes, the improvement of existing services, products and processes, and the development of new and different uses of existing products. The research and development expenditures from continuing operations have not been nor are they expected to be material. Government Regulations Roto-Rooter Roto-Rooter&#8217;s franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising laws and regulations, including the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the &#8220;FTC&#8221;) regarding the offering or sale of franchises. The rules and regulations of the FTC require that Roto-Rooter provide all the prospective franchises with specific information regarding the franchise program and Roto-Rooter in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular. In addition, a number of states require Roto-Rooter to register its franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in the state. Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i) limitations on the franchisor&#8217;s ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii) restrictions on the franchisor&#8217;s ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances under which the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchise is terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws, and (iv) provisions relating to &#160; &#160; arbitration. Roto-Rooter&#8217;s ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations and restrictions imposed by state and local licensing laws and regulations. VITAS General. The health care industry and VITAS&#8217; hospice programs are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. VITAS&#8217; hospices are licensed as required under state law as either hospices or home health agencies, or both, depending on the regulatory requirements of each particular state. In addition, VITAS&#8217; hospices are required to meet certain conditions of participation to be eligible to receive payments as hospices under Medicare and Medicaid programs. All of VITAS&#8217; hospices, other than those currently in development, are certified for participation as hospices in the Medicare program, and are also eligible to receive payments as hospices from the Medicaid program in each of the states in which VITAS operates. VITAS&#8217; hospices are subject to periodic survey by governmental authorities or private accrediting entities to assure compliance with state licensing, certification and accreditation requirements. Medicare Conditions of Participation. Federal regulations require that a hospice program satisfy certain Conditions of Participation (&#8220;COP&#8221;) to be certified and receive Medicare payment for the services it provides. Failure to comply with the conditions of participation may result in sanctions, up to and including decertification from the Medicare program. See &#8220; Surveys and Audits &#8221; below. The Medicare COP for hospice programs include the following: Governing Body . Each hospice must have a governing body that assumes full responsibility for the policies and the overall operation of the hospice and for ensuring that all services are provided in a manner consistent with accepted standards of practice. The governing body must designate one individual who is responsible for the day-to-day management of the hospice. Medical Director . Each hospice must have a medical director who is a physician and who assumes responsibility for overseeing the medical component of the hospice&#8217;s patient care program. Direct Provision of Core Services . Medicare limits those services for which the hospice may use individual independent contractors or contract agencies to provide care to patients. Specifically, substantially all nursing, social work, and counseling services must be provided directly by hospice employees meeting specific educational and professional standards. During periods of peak patient loads or under extraordinary circumstances, the hospice may be permitted to use contract workers, but the hospice must agree in writing to maintain professional, financial and administrative responsibility for the services provided by those individuals or entities. Professional Management of Non-Core Services. A hospice may arrange to have non-core services such as therapy services, home health aide services, medical supplies or drugs provided by a non-employee or outside entity. If the hospice elects to use an independent contractor to provide non-core services, however, the hospice must retain professional management responsibility for the arranged services and ensure that the services are furnished in a safe and effective manner by qualified personnel, and in accordance with the patient&#8217;s plan of care. Plan of Care . The patient&#8217;s attending physician, the medical director or the designated hospice physician, and interdisciplinary team must establish an individualized written plan of care prior to providing care to any hospice patient. The plan must assess the patient&#8217;s needs and identify services to be provided to meet those needs and must be reviewed and updated at specified intervals. Continuation of Care . A hospice may not discontinue or reduce care provided to a Medicare beneficiary if the individual becomes unable to pay for that care. Informed Consent . The hospice must obtain the informed consent of the hospice patient, or the patient&#8217;s legal representative, that specifies the type of care services that may be provided as hospice care, which is palliative and not curative care. The patient or the patient&#8217;s legal representative must also acknowledge that by choosing hospice care, certain other Medicare benefits are waived. Training . A hospice must provide ongoing training for its employees. Quality Assurance. A hospice must conduct ongoing and comprehensive self-assessments of the quality and appropriateness of care it provides and that its contractors provide under arrangements to hospice patients. Interdisciplinary Team . A hospice must designate an interdisciplinary team to provide or supervise hospice care services. The interdisciplinary team develops and updates plans of care, and establishes policies governing the day-to-day provision of hospice &#160; &#160; services. The team must include at least a physician, registered nurse, social worker and spiritual or other counselor. A registered nurse must be designated to coordinate the plan of care. Volunteers. Hospice programs are required to recruit and train volunteers to provide patient care services or administrative services. Volunteer services must be provided in an amount equal to at least five percent of the total patient care hours provided by all paid hospice employees and contract staff. Licensure . Each hospice and all hospice personnel must be licensed, certified or registered in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. Central Clinical Records . Hospice programs must maintain clinical records for each hospice patient that are organized in such a way that they may be easily retrieved. The clinical records must be complete and accurate and protected against loss, destruction and unauthorized use. Surveys and Audits . Hospice programs are subject to periodic survey by federal and state regulatory authorities and private accrediting entities to ensure compliance with applicable licensing and certification requirements and accreditation standards. Regulators conduct periodic surveys of hospice programs and provide reports containing statements of deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with various regulatory requirements. Survey reports and statements of deficiencies are common in the healthcare industry. In most cases, the hospice program and regulatory authorities will agree upon any steps to be taken to bring the hospice into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In some cases, however, a state or federal regulatory authority may take a number of adverse actions against a hospice program, including the imposition of fines, payment suspensions, temporary suspension of admission of new patients to the hospice&#8217;s service, or, in extreme circumstances, decertification from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs or revocation of the hospice&#8217;s license. CMS has recently started implementing a Targeted Probe and Educate (&#8220;TPE&#8221;) program, designed to improve compliance in submitting Medicare claims and reduce deficiencies. In the TPE program, a healthcare provider has up to three rounds of review to sufficiently improve results, or the provider may face significant action from CMS. During the rounds of a TPE review, payment of claims subject to the review is delayed. From time to time VITAS receives survey reports containing statements of deficiencies and sustains related adverse actions. VITAS reviews such reports and takes appropriate corrective action, including where appropriate, appealing the reports and any adverse actions discussed in the reports. VITAS believes that its hospices are in material compliance with applicable licensure and certification requirements. If a VITAS hospice were found to be out of compliance and actions were taken against a VITAS hospice, they could materially adversely affect the hospice&#8217;s ability to continue to operate, to provide certain services and to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could materially adversely affect VITAS. Billing Audits\/ Claims Reviews . The Medicare program and its Medicare Administrative Contractors and other payors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits of health care claims, including hospice claims. There is pressure from state and federal governments and other payors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity and appropriateness. In order to conduct these reviews, the payor requests documentation from VITAS and then reviews that documentation to determine compliance with applicable rules and regulations, including the eligibility of patients to receive hospice benefits, the appropriateness of the care provided to those patients and the documentation of that care. VITAS&#8217; claims are periodically subject to review and audit. We make appropriate provisions in our accounting records to reduce our revenue for anticipated denial or delay of payment related to these audits and reviews. We believe our hospice programs comply with all payor requirements at the time of billing. However, we cannot predict whether future billing reviews or similar audits by payors will result in material delays, suspensions, denials or reductions in revenue. Corporate Integrity Agreement . VITAS and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (&#8220;CIA&#8221;) with the Office of the Inspector General (&#8220;OIG&#8221;) on October 30, 2017 in connection with the settlement of a False Claims Act Case. The CIA formalizes various aspects of VITAS&#8217; already existing Compliance Program and contains requirements designed to document ongoing compliance with federal healthcare program requirements. It has a term of five years during which it imposes monitoring, reporting, certification, oversight, screening and training obligations, certain of which had previously been implemented by VITAS. VITAS is currently in year three of its obligations under the CIA. It also requires VITAS to engage an Independent Review Organization to perform auditing and review functions and to prepare reports regarding compliance with federal healthcare programs. In the event of breach of the CIA, VITAS could become liable for payment of stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs. Certificate of Need Laws and Other Restrictions . Some states, including Florida, have certificate of need or similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers. These states may require some form of state agency review or approval prior to &#160; &#160; opening a new hospice program, to adding or expanding hospice services, to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under other specified circumstances. Approval under these certificate of need laws is generally conditioned on the showing of a demonstrable need for services in the community. VITAS may seek to develop, acquire or expand hospice programs in states having certificate of need laws. To the extent that state agencies require VITAS to obtain a certificate of need or other similar approvals to expand services at existing hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs in new or existing geographic markets, VITAS&#8217; plans could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain such certificate or approval. In addition, competitors may seek administratively or judicially to challenge such an approval or proposed approval by the state agency. Such a challenge, whether or not ultimately successful, could adversely affect VITAS. Limitations on For-Profit Ownership. A few states have laws that restrict the development and expansion of for-profit hospice programs. For example, in New York, a hospice generally cannot be owned by a corporation that has another corporation as a stockholder. These types of restrictions could affect VITAS&#8217; ability to expand into New York, or in other jurisdictions with similar restrictions. Limits on the Acquisition or Conversion of Non-Profit Health Care Organizations. A number of states have enacted laws that restrict the ability of for-profit entities to acquire or otherwise assume the operations of a non-profit health care provider. Some states may require government review, public hearings, and\/or government approval of transactions in which a for-profit entity proposes to purchase certain non-profit healthcare organizations. Heightened scrutiny of these transactions may significantly increase the costs associated with future acquisitions of non-profit hospice programs in some states, otherwise increase the difficulty in completing those acquisitions or prevent them entirely. VITAS cannot assure that it will not encounter regulatory or governmental obstacles in connection with any proposed acquisition of non-profit hospice programs in the future. Professional Licensure and Participation Agreements . Many hospice employees are subject to federal and state laws and regulations governing the ethics and practice of their profession, including physicians, physical, speech and occupational therapists, social workers, home health aides, pharmacists and nurses. In addition, those professionals who are eligible to participate in the Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs as individuals must not have been excluded from participation in those programs at any time. State Licensure of Hospice . Each of VITAS&#8217; hospices must be licensed in the state in which it operates. State licensure rules and regulations require that VITAS&#8217; hospices maintain certain standards and meet certain requirements, which may vary from state to state. VITAS believes that its hospices are in material compliance with applicable licensure requirements. If a VITAS hospice were found to be out of compliance and actions were taken against a VITAS hospice, they could materially adversely affect the hospice&#8217;s ability to continue to operate, to provide certain services and to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could materially adversely affect VITAS. Overview of Government Payments&#8212;General . Over 95% of VITAS&#8217; revenue consisted of payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Such payments are made primarily on a &#8220;per diem&#8221; basis. Under the per diem reimbursement methodology, VITAS is essentially at risk for the cost of eligible services provided to hospice patients. Profitability is therefore largely dependent upon VITAS&#8217; ability to manage the costs of providing hospice services to patients. Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supply costs that are subject to inflation and other increases, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaid rates, could have a material adverse effect on VITAS&#8217; business in the future. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are increasing pressure to control health care costs and to decrease or limit increases in reimbursement rates for health care services. As with most government programs, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, possible retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which may adversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on VITAS&#8217; business. VITAS&#8217; levels of revenues and profitability are subject to the effect of legislative and regulatory changes, including possible reductions in coverage or payment rates, increased scrutiny of claims necessitating additional resources to respond, or changes in methods of payment, by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Overview of Government Payments &#8211; Medicare Medicare Eligibility Criteria . To receive Medicare payment for hospice services, the hospice medical director and, if the patient has one, the patient&#8217;s attending physician, must certify and describe in a brief narrative that the patient has a life expectancy of six months or less if the illness runs its normal course. This determination is made based on the physician&#8217;s clinical judgment. Due to the uncertainty of such prognoses, however, it is likely and expected that some percentage of hospice patients will not die within six months of entering a hospice program. The Medicare program (among other third-party payers) recognizes that terminal illnesses often do not follow an entirely predictable course, and therefore the hospice benefit remains available to beneficiaries so long as the hospice physician or the patient&#8217;s attending physician continues to certify that the patient&#8217;s life expectancy remains six months or less and the patient or patient&#8217;s legal representative, continues to maintain the hospice election. Specifically, the Medicare hospice benefit provides for two initial 90 day benefit periods followed by an unlimited number of 60 day periods. In order to qualify for hospice care, a Medicare &#160; &#160; beneficiary must elect hospice care and waive any right to other Medicare benefits related to his or her terminal illness. A Medicare beneficiary may revoke his or her election of the Medicare hospice benefit at any time and resume receiving regular Medicare benefits. The patient may elect the hospice benefit again at a later date so long as he or she remains eligible. The Medicare program, however, has reaffirmed that Medicare hospice beneficiaries are not limited to six months of coverage and that there is no limit on how long a Medicare beneficiary can continue to receive hospice benefits and services, provided that the beneficiary continues to meet the eligibility criteria under the Medicare hospice program. Levels of Care . Medicare pays for hospice services on a prospective payment system basis under which VITAS receives an established payment rate for each day that it provides hospice services to a Medicare beneficiary. These rates are subject to annual adjustments for inflation and vary based upon the geographic location where the services are provided. The rate VITAS receives depends on which level of care is being provided to the beneficiary. There are four levels of care and related reimbursement within the Medicare Hospice Benefit. These levels of care are Routine Home Care, Continuous Care, Inpatient Care and Respite Care. Medicare hospice providers are required under Medicare&#8217;s Conditions of Participation and their regulations to provide all four levels of care, available on a 24\/7 basis, when appropriate. VITAS, as required under Medicare&#8217;s Conditions of Participation and their regulations, has the ability to provide all levels of care to its patients. The actual level of care a patient receives on any given day is based upon the clinical needs of the patient. Routine Home Care . The routine home care rate is paid for each day that a patient is in a hospice program and is not receiving one of the other categories of hospice care. The routine home care rate is a two tiered rate, with a higher rate for the first 60 days of a hospice patient&#8217;s care and a lower rate for days 61 and after. In addition there is a Service Intensity Add-on payment which covers direct home care visits conducted by a registered nurse or social worker in the last seven days of a hospice patient&#8217;s life, reimbursed up to 4 hours per day in 15 minute increments at the continuous care rate. General Inpatient Care . The general inpatient care rate is paid when a patient requires inpatient services for a short period for pain control or symptom management which cannot be managed in other settings. General inpatient care services must be provided in a Medicare or Medicaid certified hospital or long-term care facility or at a freestanding inpatient hospice facility with the required registered nurse staffing. Continuous Home Care. Continuous home care, which VITAS refers to as &#8220;Intensive Comfort Care,&#8221; is provided to patients while at home, during periods of crisis when intensive monitoring and care, primarily nursing care, is required in order to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms. Continuous home care requires a minimum of 8 hours of care within a 24 hour day, which begins and ends at midnight. The care must be predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse. While the published Medicare continuous home care rates are daily rates, Medicare actually pays for continuous home care in 15 minute increments. This 15 minute rate is calculated by dividing the daily rate by 96. Respite Care . Respite care permits a hospice patient to receive services on an inpatient basis for a short period of time in order to provide relief for the patient&#8217;s family or other caregivers from the demands of caring for the patient. A hospice can receive payment for respite care for a given patient for up to five consecutive days at a time, after which respite care is reimbursed at the routine home care rate. Medicare Payment for Physician Services. Payment for direct patient care physician services delivered by hospice physicians is billed separately by the hospice to the Medicare Administrative Contractors and paid at the lesser of the actual charge or the Medicare allowable charge for these services. This payment is in addition to the per diem rates VITAS receives for hospice care. Payment for hospice physicians&#8217; administrative and general supervisory activities is included in the daily rates discussed above. Payments for attending physician professional services (other than services furnished by hospice physicians) are not paid to the hospice, but rather are paid directly to the attending physician by the Medicare Administrative Contractors. For fiscal 2019, less than 2% of VITAS&#8217; net revenue was attributable to physician services. Medicare Limits on Hospice Care Payments . Medicare payments for hospice services are subject to two additional limits or &#8220;caps&#8221;. Each of VITAS&#8217; hospice programs is separately subject to both of these &#8220;caps&#8221;. Both of these &#8220;caps&#8221; are determined on an annual basis for the period running from November 1 through October 31 of each year. First, under a Medicare rule known as the &#8220;80-20&#8221; rule applicable to the Medicare inpatient services, if the number of inpatient care days furnished by a hospice to Medicare beneficiaries exceeds 20% of the total days of hospice care furnished by such hospice to Medicare beneficiaries, Medicare payments to the hospice for inpatient care days exceeding the cap are reduced to the routine home care rate. &#160; &#160; Second, Medicare payments to a hospice are also subject to a separate cap based on overall average payments per admission. Any payments exceeding this overall hospice cap must be refunded by the hospice. This cap was set at $29,205.44 per admission for the twelve month period ended on October 31, 2019, increased to $29,964.78 for the twelve month period ending on October 31, 2020, and is adjusted annually to account for inflation. VITAS&#8217; hospices may be subject to future payment reductions or recoupments as the result of this cap. Medicare Managed Care Programs . The Medicare program has entered into contracts with managed care companies to provide managed care benefits to Medicare beneficiaries who elect to participate in managed care programs. These managed care programs are commonly referred to as Medicare HMOs, Medicare Advantage or Medicare risk products. VITAS provides hospice care to Medicare beneficiaries who participate in these managed care programs, and VITAS is paid for services provided to these beneficiaries in the same way and at the same rates as those of other Medicare beneficiaries who are not in a Medicare managed care program. Under current Medicare policy, Medicare pays the hospice directly for services provided to these managed care program participants. Overview of Government Payments &#8211; Medicaid Medicaid Coverage and Reimbursements. State Medicaid programs are another source of VITAS&#8217; net patient revenue. Medicaid is a state-administered program financed by state funds and federal funds to provide medical assistance to the indigent and certain other eligible persons. For those states that elect to provide a hospice benefit, the Medicaid program is required to pay the hospice at rates at least equal to the rates provided under Medicare and calculated using the same methodology. States maintain flexibility to establish their own hospice election procedures and to limit the number and duration of benefit periods for which they will pay for hospice services. Reimbursement from state Medicaid programs in 2019 accounted for approximately 4% of VITAS&#8217; revenues. Nursing Home Residents. For VITAS&#8217; patients who receive nursing home care under a state Medicaid program and who elect hospice care under Medicare or Medicaid, VITAS contracts with nursing homes for the nursing homes&#8217; provision of room and board services. In addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice daily or hourly rate, the state generally must pay VITAS an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid daily nursing home rate for room and board services furnished to the patient by the nursing home. Under VITAS&#8217; standard nursing home contracts, VITAS pays the nursing home for these room and board services at the Medicaid daily nursing home rate. Adjustments to Medicare and Medicaid Payment Rates. Payment rates under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are adjusted annually for inflation based upon the Hospital Market Basket Index and the Consumer Price Index; however, the adjustments have historically been less than actual inflation. These base rates are further modified by the Hospice Wage Index to reflect local differences in wages according to the revised wage index. Effective April 1, 2013, the Federal government implemented a 2% reimbursement cut for all Medicare programs, including hospice. It is possible that there will be further modifications to the rate structure under which the Medicare or Medicaid programs pay for hospice care services; the current cut is scheduled to last through the Federal Government&#8217;s fiscal year 2027. Any future reductions in the rate of increase or an actual decrease in Medicare and Medicaid payments may have an adverse impact on VITAS&#8217; net patient service revenue and profitability. On July 31, 2015, CMS published the final full year 2016 hospice wage index providing guidance to hospice providers regarding changes to hospice reimbursement for full year 2016. Effective January 1, 2016 the routine home care rate changed to reflect a two-tiered rate, with a higher rate for the first 60 days of a hospice patient&#8217;s care, and a lower rate for days 61 and after. In addition, the full year 2016 wage rule provides reimbursement of a Service Intensity Add-on payment. This Service Intensity Add-on payment also went into effect on January 1, 2016, and applies to direct home care visits conducted by a registered nurse or social worker in the last seven days of a hospice patient&#8217;s life while on the routine home care level of care. On August 6, 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released the fiscal year 2020 hospice wage index and payment rate update (FY 2020 update). The FY 2020 update includes the normal yearly inflationary increase by level of care plus a rebasing of the continuous care, inpatient care and respite care rates. The rebasing of these levels of care was to reflect non-inflationary changes in providers&#8217; costs over time. The rebasing increased the national average reimbursement rate for continuous care by 39.9% and inpatient care by 34.7%. Respite care is not material to our operations. The rebasing of these levels of care was effective on October 1, 2019. Managed Medicaid . In some states in which VITAS operates, the state legislatures have established managed Medicaid programs. Managed Medicaid programs outsource the process of eligibility determination and payment by Medicaid to private insurance companies. In some states, participants are required to choose a managed Medicaid provider. VITAS negotiates participant eligibility and documentation requirements, as well as hospice pay rates with each managed Medicaid provider. These requirements and pay rates may or may not align with the applicable Medicare hospice regulations and pay rates. &#160; &#160; Other Healthcare Regulations Federal and State Anti-Kickback Laws and Safe Harbor Provisions . The federal Anti-Kickback Law makes it a felony to knowingly and willingly offer, pay, solicit or receive any form of remuneration in exchange for referring, recommending, arranging, purchasing, leasing or ordering items or services covered by a federal health care program including Medicare or Medicaid. The Anti-Kickback Law applies regardless of whether the remuneration is provided directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind. Although the Anti-Kickback statute does not prohibit all financial transactions or relationships that providers of healthcare items or services may have with each other, interpretations of the law have been very broad. Under current law, courts and federal regulatory authorities have stated that this law is violated if even one purpose (as opposed to the sole or primary purpose) of the arrangement is to induce referrals. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Law carry potentially severe penalties including imprisonment of up to ten years, criminal fines of up to $100,000 per act, civil money penalties of up to $100,000 per act, and additional damages of up to three times the amounts claimed or remuneration offered or paid. Federal law also authorizes exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs for violations of the Anti-Kickback Law. The Anti-Kickback Law contains several statutory exceptions to the broad prohibition. In addition, Congress authorized the OIG to publish numerous &#8220;safe harbors&#8221; that exempt some practices from enforcement action under the Anti-Kickback Law and related laws. These statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protect various bona fide employment relationships, contracts for the rental of space or equipment, personal service arrangements, and management contracts, among other things, provided that certain conditions set forth in the statute or regulations are satisfied. The safe harbor regulations, however, do not comprehensively describe all lawful relationships between healthcare providers and referral sources, and the failure of an arrangement to satisfy all of the requirements of a particular safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement is unlawful. Failure to comply with the safe harbor provisions, however, may mean that the arrangement will be subject to scrutiny. Many states, including states where VITAS does business, have adopted similar prohibitions against payments that are intended to induce referrals of patients, regardless of the source of payment. Some of these state laws lack explicit &#8220;safe harbors&#8221; that may be available under federal law. Sanctions under these state anti-kickback laws may include civil money penalties, license suspension or revocation, exclusion from the Medicare or Medicaid programs, and criminal fines or imprisonment. Little precedent exists regarding the interpretation or enforcement of these statutes. VITAS is required under the Medicare conditions of participation and some state licensing laws to contract with numerous healthcare providers and practitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursing homes, and to arrange for these individuals or entities to provide services to VITAS&#8217; patients. In addition, VITAS has contracts with other suppliers, including pharmacies, ambulance services and medical equipment companies. Some of these individuals or entities may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to VITAS, and VITAS may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to these individuals or entities. These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor. VITAS from time to time seeks guidance from regulatory counsel as to the changing and evolving interpretations and the potential applicability of these anti-kickback laws to its programs, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deems appropriate. The Company generally believes that VITAS&#8217; contracts and arrangements with providers, practitioners and suppliers do not violate applicable anti-kickback laws. However, the Company cannot assure that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with VITAS&#8217; practices. HIPAA Anti-Fraud Provisions . HIPAA includes several revisions to existing health care fraud laws by permitting the imposition of civil monetary penalties in cases involving violations of the anti-kickback statute or contracting with excluded providers. In addition, HIPAA created statutes making it a federal felony to engage in fraud, theft, embezzlement, or the making of false statements with respect to healthcare benefit programs, which include private, as well as government programs. In addition, federal enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from the Medicare and Medicaid programs any investors, officers and managing employees associated with business entities that have committed healthcare fraud, even if the investor, officer or employee had no actual knowledge of the fraud. OIG Fraud Alerts, Advisory Opinions and Other Program Guidance . The OIG identifies and seeks to eliminate fraud, abuse and waste in HHS programs. The OIG conducts audits, investigations and inspections and issues public pronouncements identifying practices that may be subject to heightened scrutiny. There have been a number of hospice related audits and reviews conducted. These reviews and recommendations have included: &#61623; Ensuring that Medicare hospice eligibility determinations are made in accordance with the Medicare regulations; and &#61623; Revising the annual cap on hospice benefits to better reflect the cost of care provided. From time to time, various federal and state agencies, such as HHS and the OIG, issue a variety of pronouncements, including fraud alerts, the OIG&#8217;s Annual Work Plan and other reports, identifying practices that may be subject to heightened governmental &#160; &#160; scrutiny. The Company cannot predict what, if any, changes may be implemented in coverage, reimbursement, or enforcement policies as a result of these OIG reviews and recommendations. On October 30, 2017, the Company entered into a settlement agreement (the &#8220;Settlement Agreement&#8221;) to resolve civil litigation under the False Claims Act brought by the United States Department of Justice (&#8220;DOJ&#8221;) on behalf of the OIG and various relators concerning VITAS, filed in the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Missouri . The Company denied any violation of law and agreed to settlement without admission of wrongdoing. In connection with the settlement VITAS and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a corporate integrity agreement (&#8220;CIA&#8221;) on October 30, 2017. The CIA formalizes various aspects of VITAS&#8217; already existing Compliance Program and contains requirements designed to document compliance with federal healthcare program requirements. It has a term of five years during which it imposes monitoring, reporting, certification, oversight, screening and training obligations, certain of which had previously been implemented by VITAS. It also requires VITAS to engage an Independent Review Organization to perform audit and review functions and to prepare reports regarding compliance with federal healthcare programs. In the event of breach of the CIA, VITAS could become liable for payment of stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs. Federal False Claims Acts. The federal law includes several criminal and civil false claims provisions, which provide that knowingly submitting claims for items or services that were not provided as represented may result in the imposition of multiple damages, administrative civil money penalties, criminal fines, imprisonment, and\/or exclusion from participation in federally funded healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the OIG may impose extensive and costly corporate integrity requirements upon a healthcare provider that is the subject of a false claims judgment or settlement. These requirements may include the creation of a formal compliance program, the appointment of a government monitor, and the imposition of annual reporting requirements and audits conducted by an independent review organization to monitor compliance with the terms of the agreement and relevant laws and regulations. The Affordable Care Act also contains provisions aimed at strengthening fraud and abuse enforcement. As described above, VITAS and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a CIA with the OIG on October 30, 2017 in connection with the prior settlement of a False Claims Act Case. The Civil False Claims Act prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payments. Penalties for violations include fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 (as adjusted for inflation), plus treble damages, for each claim filed. Provisions in the Civil False Claims Act also permit individuals to bring actions against individuals or businesses in the name of the government as &#8220;qui tam&#8221; relators. If a qui tam relator&#8217;s claim is successful, he or she is entitled to share the government&#8217;s recovery. Both direct enforcement activity by the government and qui tam actions have increased significantly and have increased the risk that a healthcare company may have to defend a false claims action, pay fines or be excluded from the Medicare and\/or Medicaid programs as a result of an investigation arising out of this type of an action. Because of the complexity of the government regulations applicable to the healthcare industry, the Company cannot assure that VITAS will not be the subject of other actions under the False Claims Act. State False Claims Laws. Several states in which VITAS currently operates have adopted state false claims laws that mirror to some degree the federal false claims laws. While these statutes vary in scope and effect, the penalties for violating these false claims laws include administrative, civil and\/or criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, and the imposition of multiple damages. The Stark Law and State Physician Self-Referral Laws. Section 1877 of the Social Security Act, commonly known as the &#8220;Stark Law&#8221;, prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients for &#8220;designated health services&#8221; to entities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest or with whom they have a compensation arrangement, subject to a number of statutory and regulatory exceptions. Penalties for violating the Stark Law are severe and include: &#61623; Denial of payment; &#61623; Civil monetary penalties of $15,000 per referral or $100,000 for &#8220;circumvention schemes;&#8221; &#61623; Assessments equal to 200% of the dollar value of each such service provided; and &#61623; Exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Hospice care itself is not specifically listed as a designated health service; however, certain services that VITAS provides, or in the future may provide, are among the services identified as designated health services for purposes of the self-referral laws. The &#160; &#160; Company cannot assure that future regulatory changes will not result in hospice services becoming subject to the Stark Law&#8217;s ownership, investment or compensation prohibitions in the future. Many states where VITAS operates have laws similar to the Stark Law, but with broader effect because they apply regardless of the source of payment for care. Penalties similar to those listed above as well as the loss of state licensure may be imposed in the event of a violation of these state self-referral laws. Little precedent exists regarding the interpretation or enforcement of these statutes. Civil Monetary Penalties. The Civil Monetary Penalties Statute provides that civil penalties ranging between $20,000 and $100,000 per claim or act may be imposed on any person or entity that knowingly submits improperly filed claims for federal health benefits or that offers or makes payment to induce a beneficiary or provider to reduce or limit the use of health care services or to use a particular provider or supplier. Civil monetary penalties may be imposed for violations of the anti-kickback statute and for the failure to return known overpayments, among other things. Prohibition on Employing or Contracting with Excluded Providers. The Social Security Act and federal regulations state that individuals or entities that have been convicted of a criminal offense related to the delivery of an item or service under Medicare or Medicaid programs or that have been convicted, under state and federal law, of a criminal offense relating to neglect or abuse of residents in connection with the delivery of a healthcare item or service cannot participate in any federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Additionally, individuals and entities convicted of fraud, that have had their licenses revoked or suspended, or that have failed to provide services of adequate quality also may be excluded from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Federal regulations prohibit Medicare providers, including hospice programs, from submitting claims for items or services or their related costs if an excluded provider furnished those items or services. The OIG maintains a list of excluded persons and entities. Nonetheless, it is possible that VITAS might unknowingly bill for services provided by an excluded person or entity with whom it contracts. The penalty for contracting with an excluded provider may range from civil monetary penalties of $100,000 and damages of up to three times the amount of payment that was inappropriately received. Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee Splitting. Most states have laws that restrict or prohibit anyone other than a licensed physician, including business entities such as corporations, from employing physicians and\/or prohibit payments or fee-splitting arrangements between physicians and corporations or unlicensed individuals. Penalties for violations of corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting laws vary from state to state, but may include civil or criminal penalties, the restructuring or termination of the business arrangements between the physician and unlicensed individual or business entity, or even the loss of the physician&#8217;s license to practice medicine. These laws vary widely from state to state both in scope and origin (e.g. statute, regulation, Attorney General opinion, court ruling, agency policy) and in most instances have been subject to only limited interpretation by the courts or regulatory bodies. VITAS employs or contracts with physicians to provide medical direction and patient care services to its patients. VITAS has made efforts in those states where certain contracting or fee arrangements are restricted or prohibited to structure those arrangements, including its palliative care offerings, in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. Despite these efforts, however, the Company cannot assure that agency officials charged with enforcing these laws will not interpret VITAS&#8217; contracts with employed or independent contractor physicians as violating the relevant laws or regulations. Future determinations or interpretations by individual states with corporate practice of medicine or fee splitting restrictions may force VITAS to restructure its arrangements with physicians in those locations. Health Information Practices. There currently are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state and federal levels that address patient privacy concerns. In particular, federal regulations issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;) and the Health Information Technology for Electronic and Clinical Health Act (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;) require VITAS to protect the privacy and security of patients&#8217; individual health information. HIPAA and HITECH do not automatically preempt applicable state laws and regulations concerning VITAS&#8217; use, disclosure and maintenance of patient health information, which means that VITAS is subject to a complex regulatory scheme that, in many instances, requires VITAS to comply with both federal and state laws and regulations. If we are found to have violated these laws, we could be subject to sanctions, fines, damages, and other civil and criminal penalties. Additional Federal and State Regulation. Federal and state governments also regulate various aspects of the hospice industry. In particular, VITAS&#8217; operations are subject to federal and state health regulatory laws covering professional services, the dispensing of drugs and certain types of hospice activities. Some of VITAS&#8217; employees are subject to state laws and regulations governing the ethics and professional practice of medicine, respiratory therapy, pharmacy and nursing. Compliance with Health Regulatory Laws. VITAS maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time to time retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters. The Company cannot assure, however, that VITAS&#8217; practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable health regulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with such laws would not have a material adverse effect, including an effect on its brand reputation, on VITAS. &#160; &#160; Environmental Matters Roto-Rooter&#8217;s operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding environmental matters and other aspects of the operation of a sewer and drain cleaning, plumbing, and water restoration services business. For certain other activities, such as septic tank and grease trap pumping, Roto-Rooter is subject to state and local environmental health and sanitation regulations. At December 31, 2019, the Company&#8217;s accrual for its estimated liability for potential environmental cleanup and related costs arising from the 1991 sale of DuBois Chemicals Inc. (&#8220;DuBois&#8221;) amounted to $1.7 million. Of this balance, $901,000 is included in other liabilities and $826,000 is included in other current liabilities. The Company is contingently liable for additional DuBois-related environmental cleanup and related costs up to a maximum of $14.9 million. On the basis of a continuing evaluation of the Company&#8217;s potential liability, and in consultation with the Company&#8217;s environmental attorney, management believes that it is not probable this additional liability will be paid. Accordingly, no provision for this contingent liability has been recorded. Although it is not presently possible to reliably project the timing of payments related to the Company&#8217;s potential liability for environmental costs, management believes that any adjustments to its recorded liability will not materially adversely affect its financial position or results of operations. The Company, to the best of its knowledge, is currently in compliance in all material respects with the environmental laws and regulations affecting its operations. Such environmental laws, regulations and enforcement proceedings have not required the Company to make material increases in or modifications to its capital expenditures and they have not had a material adverse effect on sales or net income. Capital expenditures for the purpose of complying with environmental laws and regulations during 2019 and 2020 with respect to continuing operations are not expected to be material in amount; there can be no assurance, however, that presently unforeseen legislative enforcement actions will not require additional expenditures. Employees On December 31, 2019, the Company had a total of 16,641 employees. Acquisitions In 2019, Roto-Rooter made two separate acquisitions of territories from former franchisees. The territories purchased are primarily located in the southwestern United States, including Los Angeles, Oakland, Dallas, and Phoenix. These acquisitions were part of Roto-Rooter&#8217;s ongoing strategy of acquiring franchises to boost productivity, market share and profitability.

COVID&#8211;19 Global Pandemic The global Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) has caused and continues to cause global economic disruption and uncertainty, including in our business. The adverse global economic impact of this pandemic has had an adverse impact on parts of our business, customers, and suppliers and caused many challenges for our business operations during fiscal 2020. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our future business, strategic initiatives, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration, spread, severity and resurgence, of COVID-19, the effects of COVID-19 on our customers, vendors and employees and the remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by local and federal governments, and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. We will continue to evaluate the nature and scope of the impact to our business and may take further actions strategizing our business operations and managing our costs and liquidity that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond to this fast moving and uncertain global health crisis and the resulting global economic consequences.

We will also continue to build our client portfolio in Finance and Accounting and Consulting services in all of our business segments in an opportunistic manner. As we can continue to refine our focus, we are pursuing opportunities in other industries. We are strategically equipped to help clients apply relevant digital technologies to enterprise processes and business problems at every step of the digital transformation value chain in operations management with capabilities across Data and Data management, Business intelligence and Analytics, AI, Digital Transformation Consulting, Digital Integration and Operations. Demand for these services is expected to exhibit strong growth in the next several years. Integrating our capabilities Our deep domain expertise has been central to our market differentiation. We are also well-positioned as one of the few players in the market with a full suite of data and analytics, strong operational excellence and digital toolkit to create integrated services and solutions under one brand. Cultivating Long-term Relationships and Expanding our Client Base We continue to maintain our focus on cultivating long-term client relationships as well as attracting new clients. We believe there are significant opportunities for additional growth within our existing clients, and we seek to expand these relationships by: &#8226; Increasing the depth and breadth of the services we provide across our clients&#8217; value chains and geographies; &#8226; Offering the full suite of EXL services that includes operations management (including consulting; digital transformation) and data and analytics; and &#8226; Supporting our clients&#8217; geographic expansion leveraging our global footprint. We intend to continue building a portfolio of Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies in our focus industries that have the most complex and diverse data-led processes and, accordingly, stand to benefit significantly from our services. We also intend to cultivate long-term relationships with medium-sized companies in our focus industries leveraging our BPaaS and digital offerings. Expanding our Global Delivery Footprint and Operational Infrastructure We intend to further expand and invest in our network of delivery centers to service our clients. In 2020, we expanded our operations centers in India, the Philippines and Colombia. Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions and Relationships We intend to continue making selective acquisitions in our focus industry verticals that enhance our competitive differentiation and facilitate our growth strategy. We consider selective strategic relationships with industry leaders that add new long-term client relationships, enhance the depth and breadth of our services and solutions and complement our business strategy. Through our Connected Intelligence Partnership programs we expand our technology and innovation ecosystem with select partnerships, alliances or investments that we expect will enhance go-to-market opportunities and expand the scope and effectiveness of our services and solutions by adding digital assets and intellectual property, which will help us to win new clients or allowing us to enter new industry verticals and geographic markets. Our Industry Operations Management BPM service providers work with clients to transfer their key business processes to reduce costs, improve process quality, handle increased transaction volumes and reduce redundancy. BPM providers can enable organizations to enhance profitability and increase efficiency and reliability, permitting them to concentrate on their core areas of competence. BPM is a long-term strategic commitment for a company that, once implemented, is generally not subject to cyclical spending or information technology budget fluctuations. Increased global demand, cost improvements in international communications and the automation of many business services have created a significant opportunity for BPM providers with offshore delivery capabilities, and many companies are moving select office processes to providers with the capacity to perform these functions from overseas locations. We believe the demand for BPM services will be primarily led by industries that are transaction-driven and that require significant customer interactions. Analytics Companies are increasingly looking for a suite of third party analytics services, including statistical tools, models and techniques to clean, organize and examine structured and unstructured corporate data. This data is then used by companies to generate specific business-related analysis and insights into their business and prospects. The enhanced generation of business data across multiple formats, substantial reduction in data storage costs, growing enterprise demand for data-driven and real-time decision making and availability of sophisticated analytics tools have enabled companies to overcome a local shortage of specialized analytics talent and benefit from global labor markets. Our service offerings develop industry-specific analytics solutions and deep data insights that are especially well poised to benefit from this global trend. Sales, Marketing and Client Management We market our services to our existing and prospective clients through our sales and client management teams, which are aligned by industry verticals and cross-industry domains such as finance and accounting and consulting. Our sales and client management teams operate from the U.S., Europe, Australia and South Africa are supported by our business development teams. Our sales, marketing and business development teams are responsible for new client acquisitions, public relations, relations with outsourcing advisory companies, analyst relations and rankings, lead generation, knowledge management, content development, campaign management, digital or web presence, brand awareness and participation in industry forums and conferences. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 171 sales, marketing, business development and client management professionals with the majority of them based in either the U.S. or Europe. Our professionals generally have significant experience in business process services, technology, operations, analytics and consulting. Clients EXL generated revenues from approximately 460 clients and 470 clients in 2020 and 2019, respectively (with annual revenue exceeding $50,000 per client). We have won 44 and 28 new clients during 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our top three, five and ten clients generated 19.2%, 25.4% and 37.4 % of our revenues, respectively, in 2020. Our top three, five and ten clients generated 15.2%, 22.0% and 36.1% of our revenues, respectively, in 2019. No client accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in 2020 or 2019. Our revenue concentration with our top clients remains consistent year-over-year and we continue to develop relationships with new clients to diversify our client base. We believe that the loss of any of our ten largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. See Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; under &#8220;Risks Related to Our Business-We earn a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of clients.&#8221; Our long-term relationships with our clients typically evolve from providing a single, discrete service or process into providing a series of complex, integrated processes across multiple business lines. For operations management services other than consulting, we enter into long-term agreements with our clients with typical initial terms of between three to five years. Consulting engagements have typical terms of six to twelve months. Agreements for Analytics services are either project based or have shorter initial terms, which are typically between one to three years. However, each agreement is individually negotiated with the client. Competition Competition in the BPM services industry is intense and growing. See Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; under &#8220;Risks Related to Our Business-We face competition from U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based BPM and IT companies and from our clients, who may build shared services centers to perform BPM and Analytics services themselves, either in-house, in the United States or through offshore groups or other arrangements.&#8221; Many companies, including certain of our clients, choose to perform some or all of their customer-facing and back-office processes internally, utilizing their own employees to provide these services as part of their regular business operations. Some companies have moved portions of their in-house customer management functions offshore, including to offshore affiliates. We believe our key advantage over in-house business processes management is that we provide companies the opportunity to focus on their core products and markets while we focus on service delivery and operational excellence. We compete primarily against: &#8226; large global companies with BPM solutions and delivery capabilities in offshore locations, such as Genpact Limited, WNS (Holdings) Limited, Accenture, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services; &#8226; niche providers that provide services in a specific geographic market, industry or service area, such as analytics or healthcare; and &#8226; leading accounting and management consulting firms. We compete against these entities by working to establish ourselves as a service provider with deep industry expertise, strong client relationships, leading industry talent, superior operational and process capabilities, differentiated technology and BPaaS solutions, and sophisticated analytic and consulting capabilities, which enable us to respond rapidly to market trends and the evolving needs of our clients. Intellectual Property Our intellectual property consists of proprietary and licensed platforms, software and databases, trade secrets, methodologies and know-how, trademarks, copyrighted software, operating procedures and other materials and patents and pending patent applications. We have numerous registered trademarks and logos registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and certain foreign jurisdictions and several pending trademark applications, as well as, three issued patents. We consider many of our business processes and implementation methodologies to be trade secrets or proprietary know-how and confidential information. To provide our services, in addition to our own proprietary tools, we use software and data licensed by us or our clients from third parties. We also use SaaS services from third parties pursuant to contracts with us or our clients. In particular, we have developed several strategic partnerships with robotics and process automation software companies to facilitate our offering of automation to our clients. Clients and business partners sign nondisclosure agreements requiring confidential treatment of our information. Our employees are required to sign work-for-hire and confidentiality covenants as a condition to their employment. Our technology group and various business lines develop proprietary tools that we deploy to support services for our clients. We typically retain ownership of any pre-existing tools including modifications or enhancements to such pre-existing tools developed while providing client services. While working on client engagements, we also often develop new tools or methodologies, including robotics and process automation software or &#8220;bots,&#8221; and we endeavor to negotiate contracts that give us ownership or licenses to use or demonstrate such tools for other clients. A lthough our proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our business, we believe our company as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular intellectual property right, other than our EXL brand. Information Security and Data Privacy Overseen by management and our board of directors, we maintain a comprehensive program that focuses on information security, cyber security, data privacy and the protection of our clients&#8217; and their customers&#8217; confidential personal and sensitive information. We have invested in our information security and cyber security posture and protocols to support compliance with our contractual obligations and the laws and regulations governing our activities. These investments include people, processes and technology intended to protect information throughout its life cycle. EXL focuses on implementing and maintaining cyber security capabilities to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from cyber threats, incidents and attacks; reduce vulnerabilities and minimize the impact of cyber incidents. We emphasize compliance and institutional governance built upon and supported by policies and processes, tools and technologies, and knowledge and awareness training. EXL takes into account guidance from relevant regulatory and governance bodies, including but not limited to the Cyber Security Framework of the National Institute of Standards and Technology of the U.S. Department of Commerce, in designing controls and policies regarding security for sensitive and confidential information of EXL's clients, employee, partners, third parties and EXL&#8217;s owned products and services. EXL has undertaken measures designed to comply with new privacy regulations, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;), as well as other national and state laws or regulations. According to the needs of our clients as well as the regulatory requirements of the geographies in which we operate, many of our delivery centers are certified related to information security and health and environmental safety, such as the ISO 27001:2013 standard for information security management systems, the ISO 22301:2012 for Business continuity management systems, the ISO 9001:2008 standard for quality management system, the ISO 14001 for environmental management standards and the OHSAS 18001:2007 standard for occupational health and safety management systems. Certain delivery centers and processes are also compliant with HITRUST CSF&#8482; and certified for other similar requirements. Some of our centers in the Philippines and South Africa and certain client processes in other operation centers in India are compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) version 3.2 or higher requirements. We engage independent firms to conduct General Controls and business process (SOC1and SOC2 - Type II) assessments on managed hosting environments that we offer in our Insurance and Healthcare verticals. EXL also engages third parties to conduct vulnerability assessment and penetration testing of its technology environment. For disaster recovery purposes, many of our key technology applications are hosted in ISO 27001 certified, SSAE18 SOC1 compliant Tier 4 data centers that are proactively monitored and managed 24 hours a day. In March 2020, as a result of COVID-19 and the implementation of our business continuity plans, many of our employees began to provide services from their homes, or other authorized remote locations. We augmented our endpoint security posture with next generation security controls including strong encryption and a secure virtual private network to access EXL or client application from these authorized locations. As we were unable to replicate physical controls in place at our delivery centers, we agreed with our clients to implement certain additional logical information security and data privacy controls on the hardware issued by EXL and used by our employees while working from home, including browsers, peripherals and operating systems restrictions, as well additional monitoring from our Cyber Defense Center. All employees providing services from home are required to agree to an undertaking of their compliance with our Telecommuter Policy. However, we continue to face certain risks related to cybersecurity threats in general and our modified delivery models due to COVID-19. See Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; under &#8220;Risks Related to Our Business-Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected, and could in the future be materially adversely affected, by the coronavirus pandemic&#8221; and under &#8220;Risks Related to Our Industry-Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer data, whether through breach of our computer systems or otherwise, could expose us to protracted and costly litigation and cause us to lose clients.&#8221; We have procured from leading technology providers and other third parties a robust, wide area network and international telecommunications capacity to support our global business operations. Our business continuity management plans include redundant locations, network infrastructure, power sources and other utilities to mitigate and manage operational risks as well as redundant, trained talent across our service delivery locations. These plans are documented, as well as tested on a periodic basis. Human Capital Management At EXL, our culture is defined by our five core values: innovation, collaboration, excellence, integrity and mutual respect. In line with those values, we consider our employees to be critical to the success of our business and view employee development and growth as key to our performance and sustainability. As of December 31, 2020, we had a headcount of approximately 31,900 employees. We have approximately 20,800 employees based in India, 7,600 employees in the Philippines, 2,000 employees in the United States, 200 employees in the United Kingdom, 400 employees in Colombia, 300 employees in the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, and 600 employees in South Africa and other geographies. None of our employees are unionized. We have never experienced any work stoppages and believe that we enjoy good employee relations. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Our diversity, equity and inclusion philosophy is to create an inclusive work environment and leverage diversity to enable the organization to effectively capitalize on the differing views and contributions that each employee brings to the workplace. We consider diversity, equity and inclusion to be a key factor in our recruiting goals and overall business growth strategy. As of December 31, 2020, of the United States reporting workforce, approximately 39.1% were racially\/ethnically diverse individuals. As of December 31, 2020, our global workforce was approximately 39.5% female, with over 12,500 women employees globally. EXL is committed to providing a supportive working environment and career opportunities for our employees. Our Diversity and Inclusion Council consists of a global, diverse mix of leaders and oversees our diversity, equity and inclusion program. We provide trainings to our employees on topics aimed at improving diversity, equity and inclusion, such as managing unconscious bias, and have formed employee resource groups for select employee communities that are aimed at supporting diverse groups and interests. For our female employees, EXL has several programs to promote career advancement, including leadership development for women at the mid- to senior- levels, a separate program to improve the retention and engagement of new mothers through employee friendly parental leave and similar policies, and our WE (Women at EXL) platform, which is designed to enable women at EXL advance their career and achieve professional growth through discussion, collaboration, networking, training, development and mentorship opportunities. In addition, we maintain a supplier diversity program in the United States designed to provide opportunities for qualified diverse businesses. Recruiting our Employees We have an integrated talent management framework that employs active collaboration between our recruitment, capability development and business human resource functions. We deploy innovative methods to recruit, train and retain our skilled employees. We focus on recruiting the right talent and developing them further on relevant competencies through our learning academies, rigorous promotion standards, client and industry specific training and competitive compensation packages that include incentive-based compensation. We are able to leverage shared resources across our services through personnel who have skill sets applicable to a wide variety of BPM services. We also have specialized experts in various domains, who develop specialization in our chosen industries and subject matters through our training academies. Our employee relations function ensures that we understand the pulse of our employees, and are able to swiftly respond to specific needs and concerns as they arise, through a central team of experts. We focus on recruiting, training and retaining our professionals. We have developed effective strategies that enable an efficient recruitment process. The recruitment and training process evolved to an online model in 2020. We have over 100 employees dedicated to recruitment. Some of the strategies we have adopted to increase efficiency in our hiring practices include AI-based intelligent screening mechanisms. Our hiring policies focus on identifying high quality employees who demonstrate a propensity for learning, contribution to client services and growth. Candidates must undergo numerous tests and video interviews, in 2020, before we extend offers for employment. We also conduct background checks on candidates, including criminal background checks, where permitted and as required by clients. In 2020, as a result of COVID-19, much of our recruiting and training of new hires was conducted virtually. Employee Benefits and Experience We offer our employees competitive compensation packages that include incentive-based compensation and offer a variety of benefits that vary by facility, including free transport to and from home in certain circumstances, subsidized meals and free access to recreational facilities that are located within some of our operations centers. In 2020, given COVID-19, we implemented a number of new measures to support our employees while working from home, including regular Company-wide town hall meetings, as well as promoting smaller virtual video-based team building activities, and a renewed employee wellness program led by a new global employee wellness team, made up of specialists such as counsellors, physicians and fitness instructors. We also took a number of COVID-19 safety measures, such as chartering a senior management-led Pandemic Management Task Force that is charged with ensuring the safety of our employees and adherence to government guidelines in each of the geographies in which we operate, and publishing guidelines for our employees on quarantine protocols, enhanced testing and tracking measures for those of our employees who are unable to work from home due to the nature of their jobs, and providing an additional four weeks of leave for those of our employees who become ill, and additional two weeks of leave for those of our employees who have to care for family members who become ill. Capability Development We maintain a strong focus on capability development, with an emphasis on digital transformation and domain expertise. Our talent development strategy is comprehensive, aligned to overall business strategy and founded on three pillars: Digital Leadership, Digital Technologies &#38; Methodologies, and Digital Culture &#38; Mindset. Digital Leadership is the ability to partner with clients on digital solutions end-to-end, from strategy to execution. Digital Technologies &#38; Methodologies develops expertise around the specific technologies, tools, and frameworks required to successfully execute projects for our clients. Digital Culture and Mindset is all about creating the right DNA for high performance in a digital economy. This includes developing traits of agility and speed, creating a culture of innovation and collaboration, and fostering a mindset to reimagine and think beyond. Digital culture also builds the foundation of self-learning and spurs the desire for change amongst all of our employees. We create thought leaders with high industry acumen who are better able to address our clients&#8217; requirements. We also provide a career-linked learning path to our employees from new hires to tenured employees to senior levels of leadership. Our domain academies focus on building domain expertise through certifications and specialization. These include our Insurance Academy, Travel Academy, Finance and Accounting Academy, Healthcare Academy, Analytics Academy, Utilities Academy, Consulting Academy and Digital Academy. These domain academies focus on achieving excellence and developing skill sets that can be used across the different domains. Our training includes behavioral and functional components to enhance and ensure job readiness as well as also boosting ongoing productivity and effectiveness. We also focus on promoting better diversity, equity and inclusion through our training programs. We have a global presence catering to the specific learning requirements of each geography. We provide learning through our blended learning methodology comprising of virtual, classroom, on the job coaching and technology led learning. Our new capability development digital ecosystem, EXL Infinity, drives learning from anywhere, anytime, any device. Objective is to harness the collective knowledge base of the Company, drive a culture continuous self-learning, and promote knowledge sharing and learning collaboration. EXL Infinity has led to curation of over 22,500 hours of learning content deploying more than 3,000 learning assets. We also designed and deployed Leading in Virtual Environment (L.I.V.E) certification program covering 300 managers globally to address current need to effectively connect, engage, manage and collaborate with teams, clients and other stakeholders who are increasingly working remotely. This certification aims to maximize their team&#8217;s synergy, productivity and client management capabilities, managers need unique set of skills to succeed. Employee Retention Our attrition rate for employees who had been with EXL for more than 180 days was 23.4% and 33.2% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The attrition rate in 2020 was lower than our historical average due to the global pandemic. It is difficult to estimate the attrition rate in 2021 at this time. As competition in our industry increases, our turnover rate could increase. See Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; under &#8220;Risks Related to Our Business-We may fail to attract and retain enough sufficiently trained employees to support our operations, as competition for highly skilled personnel is intense and we experience significant employee turnover rates, which may result in loss of revenue and an inability to expand our business; Employee wage increases may prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin.&#8221; Environmental, Social and Governance Strategy The world we work and live in is powered by innovation. We believe success in such a world will come through passing along social goods to the communities in which we operate, and ensuring that we conduct our operations in a sustainable and safe manner. These initiatives reflect our core values and will make us a stronger, more impactful organization to work for and to deliver exceptional results for our clients, employees, communities and stockholders. Our most recent Sustainability Report is available on the Company&#8217;s website. The information contained on the Company&#8217;s website is not included in, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Community Activities EXL finds meaningful ways to help the communities in which we operate. Our community activities focus on passing along the skills that our employees use in our operations to members of the communities in which we operate to help transform lives. On our own, with outside partners, and in partnership with our clients, we support market-relevant skill development and education initiatives, disaster relief efforts, and global health initiatives. These programs align with the expectations clients have of service providers, and benefit our other stakeholders. In 2020, we were able to continue many of these activities virtually. Examples include: &#8226; Skills to Win Initiative: This skill development initiative provides participants in communities in the United States, the Philippines, India and South Africa with foundational employability skills required for back-office roles, as well as courses on topics including finance and accounting, data and analytics, and digital skills. This initiative also offers placement assistance to successfully trained participants. &#8226; Education Initiative: This classroom-based initiative provides school-aged students in India, the Philippines and the United States with data and analytics skills and career guidance. Environmental, Health and Safety We strive to continuously improve in the area of environmental, health and safety initiatives (&#8220;EHS&#8221;), with a focus on reducing our carbon footprint, energy conservation, waste minimization, green infrastructure and operations. Our EHS team tracks and assesses our progress with respect to key performance indicators for energy, greenhouse gas emissions, water and waste generation targets. We have also established Company-wide and worksite-specific workplace safety objectives that are integrated into our EHS Management System. We believe that these measures will also help us in sustainable development efforts. Where practical, we seek to integrate EHS with our business activities, focusing on conducting our activities in an environmentally responsible manner and ensuring the health and safety of the Company&#8217;s employees, contractors, customers, visitors and the communities where the Company operates. In addition, we seek to maintain a responsible supply chain by confirming that our vendors&#8217; values are aligned with ours through background verifications for new suppliers with respect to policies and performance on economic, environmental, human rights, data privacy, product safety and working conditions. All of our delivery centers in India and the Philippines are ISO 14001:2015 certified, meeting international standards for effective environmental management systems. All our delivery centers have been upgraded from OHSAS 18001:2007 to ISO 45001:2018 certification for health and safety management system. We also have additional ISO 50001:2011 certifications, systemic approaches for energy management and performance. Regulation Our operations are subject to rules, regulations and statutes in the countries where we have operations and where we deliver services as a result of the diverse and complex nature of our service offerings. More often, however, our clients contractually require that we comply with certain rules and regulations applicable to their specific industries.\\ We are one of the few service providers that can provide third-party administrator insurance services from India and the Philippines and are currently able to provide such services in the U.S. for 49 states and 48 states (including the District of Columbia), respectively. Additionally, our subsidiary in the Philippines is able to provide utilization review services in the U.S. for 44 states (including the District of Columbia). Further, through domestic subsidiaries, we are licensed or otherwise eligible to provide third-party administrator services in all states within the United States, as well as utilization review , insurance adjuster, and insurance producer services in select states. We are required to maintain licenses in various jurisdictions or require certain categories of our professionals to be individually licensed in service areas such as debt collection, utilization review, workers&#8217; compensation utilization review, insurance adjuster, and telemarketing services. Our facilities in the Philippines, as well as one domestic subsidiary, are accredited by the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC) and National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), the leading healthcare and education accreditation organizations. We continue to obtain licenses and accreditations required from time to time by our business operations. Our operations are also subject to compliance with a variety of other laws, including U.S. federal and state regulations that apply to certain portions of our business such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Health Information Technology for Economics and Clinical Health Act of 2009, GDPR and the UK Bribery Act,- as well as state and local laws, such as the CCPA. We also must comply with applicable regulations relating to health, financial and other personal information that we handle as part of our services. We benefit from tax relief provided by laws and regulations in India and the Philippines from time to time. Regulation of our business by the Indian government affects us in several ways. During the last several years, we either established or acquired new centers that are eligible for tax benefits under the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005 (the &#8220;SEZ Act&#8221;). The SEZ Act introduced a 15-year tax holiday scheme for operations established in designated special economic zones (&#8220;SEZs&#8221;). Under the SEZ Act, qualifying operations are eligible for a deduction from taxable income equal to (i) 100% of their export profits derived for the first five years from the commencement of operations; (ii) 50% of such export profits for the next five years; and (iii) 50% of the export profits for a further five years, subject to satisfying certain capital investment requirements. The SEZ Act provides, among other restrictions, that this holiday is not available to operations formed by splitting up or reconstructing existing operations or transferring existing plant and equipment (beyond a prescribed limit) to new SEZ locations. Income tax exemption for new SEZ units was applicable only for units that started commercial operations on or before June 30, 2020. In 2019, the Government of India introduced a new tax regime for certain Indian companies by enacting the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019. The new tax regime is optional and provides for a lower tax rate for Indian companies, subject to agreeing to certain conditions, which, among other things, include not taking advantage of benefits from any tax holidays associated with SEZs and certain other tax incentives. Once a company has opted in to the new tax regime, it may not in the future opt out. During 2019 and 2020, our Indian subsidiaries opted into this new tax regime and accordingly gave up the tax exemption associated with SEZs that were used prior to opting in. See Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; under &#8220;Risks Related to the International Nature of Our Business-Our financial condition could be negatively affected if foreign governments introduces new legislation, reduce or withdraw tax benefits and other incentives currently provided to companies within our industry or if we are not eligible for these benefits.&#8221; We also benefitted from a corporate tax holiday in the Philippines for some of our operations centers established there over the last several years. The Company registered with the Philippines Economic Zone Authority (&#8220;PEZA&#8221;) and is therefore eligible for income tax exemption for four years. We anticipate establishing additional operations centers in PEZA or other tax advantaged locations in the future. This exemption incentive may be extended in certain instances upon fulfillment of certain conditions. Following the expiry of the tax exemption, income generated from centers in the Philippines will be taxed at the prevailing annual tax rate.

","3":" Item 1. BusinessOur CompanyThrough our predecessor companies, we have been in the equipment services business for approximately 60 years. H&#38;E Equipment Services L.L.C. was formed in June 2002 through the combination of Head &#38; Engquist Equipment, LLC (&#8220;Head &#38; Engquist&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gulf Wide Industries, L.L.C. (&#8220;Gulf Wide&#8221;), and ICM Equipment Company L.L.C. (&#8220;ICM&#8221;). Head &#38; Engquist, founded in 1961, and ICM, founded in 1971, were two leading regional, integrated equipment service companies operating in contiguous geographic markets. In the June 2002 transaction, Head &#38; Engquist and ICM were merged with and into Gulf Wide, which was renamed H&#38;E Equipment Services L.L.C. (&#8220;H&#38;E LLC&#8221;). In connection with our initial public offering in February 2006, we converted H&#38;E LLC into H&#38;E Equipment Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation. We are one of the largest integrated equipment services companies in the United States focused on heavy construction and industrial equipment. We rent, sell and provide parts and services support for four core categories of specialized equipment: (1) hi-lift or aerial work platform equipment&#59; (2) cranes&#59; (3) earthmoving equipment&#59; and (4) material handling equipment. We engage in five principal business activities in these equipment categories:&#160;&#8226; equipment rentals&#59; &#160;&#8226; new equipment sales&#59; &#160;&#8226; used equipment sales&#59; &#160;&#8226; parts sales&#59; and &#160;&#8226; repair and maintenance services. By providing rental, sales, parts, repair and maintenance functions under one roof, we offer our customers a one-stop solution for their equipment needs. This full-service approach provides us with (1) multiple points of customer contact&#59; (2) cross-selling opportunities among our rental, new and used equipment sales, parts sales and services operations&#59; (3) an effective method to manage our rental fleet through efficient maintenance and profitable distribution of used equipment&#59; and (4) a mix of business activities that enables us to operate effectively throughout economic cycles. We believe that the operating experience and extensive infrastructure we have developed throughout our history as an integrated equipment services company provide us with a competitive advantage over rental-focused companies and equipment distributors. In addition, our focus on four core categories of heavy construction and industrial equipment enables us to offer specialized knowledge and support to our customers.We have built an extensive infrastructure that as of February 10, 2021 includes 97 full-service facilities located throughout the Intermountain, Southwest, Gulf Coast, West Coast, Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Our work force includes distinct and focused sales forces for our new and used equipment sales and rental operations, highly skilled service technicians, product specialists, and regional and district managers. Our management, from the corporate level down to the branch store level, has extensive industry experience. We focus our rental and sales activities on, and organize our personnel principally by, our four core equipment categories. We believe this allows us to provide specialized equipment knowledge, improve the effectiveness of our rental and sales forces and strengthen our customer relationships. In addition, we operate our day-to-day business on a branch basis, which we believe allows us to more closely service our customers, fosters management accountability at local levels and strengthens our local and regional relationships.Industry BackgroundAlthough there has been some consolidation within the industry in recent years, including the acquisitions of Rental Services Corporation, NES Rentals and Neff Corporation by United Rentals, Inc. (&#8220;URI&#8221;), the U.S. construction equipment distribution industry remains highly fragmented and consists mainly of a small number of multi-location regional or national operators and a large number of relatively small, independent businesses serving discrete local markets. The industry is driven by a broad range of economic factors including total U.S. non-residential construction trends, construction machinery demand, demand for rental equipment and additional, region-specific factors. Construction equipment is largely distributed to end users through two channels: equipment rental companies and equipment dealers. Examples of equipment rental companies include URI, Sunbelt Rentals, and Hertz Equipment Rental. Examples of equipment dealers include Finning and Toromont. Unlike many of these companies, which principally focus on one channel of distribution, we operate substantially in both channels. As an integrated equipment services company, we rent, sell and provide parts and services support. Although many of the historically pure equipment rental companies also provide parts and service support to customers, their service offerings are typically limited and may prove difficult to expand due to the infrastructure, training and resources necessary to develop the breadth of offerings and depth of specialized equipment knowledge that our services and sales staff provides. Products and ServicesEquipment Rentals. We rent our heavy construction and industrial equipment to our customers on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. We have a well-maintained rental fleet that, at December 31, 2020, consisted of approximately 39,389 pieces of equipment having an original acquisition cost (which we define as the cost originally paid to manufacturers or the original amount financed under operating leases) of approximately $1.8 billion and an average age of approximately 40.9 months. Our rental business creates cross-selling opportunities for us in sales and service support activities. New Equipment Sales. We sell new heavy construction and industrial equipment in all four core equipment categories, and are a leading U.S. distributor for nationally recognized suppliers including JLG Industries, Gehl, Genie Industries (Terex), Komatsu, Takeuchi and JCB. In addition, we are the world&#8217;s largest distributor of Grove and Manitowoc crane equipment. Our new equipment sales operation is a source of new customers for our parts sales and service support activities, as well as for used equipment sales. Used Equipment Sales. We sell used equipment primarily from our rental fleet, as well as inventoried equipment that we acquire through trade-ins from our customers and selective purchases of high-quality used equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 92.5% of our used equipment sales revenues were derived from sales of rental fleet equipment. Used equipment sales, like new equipment sales, generate parts and services business for us. Parts Sales. We sell new and used parts to customers and also provide parts to our own rental fleet. We maintain an extensive in-house parts inventory in order to provide timely parts and service support to our customers as well as to our own rental fleet. In addition, our parts operations enable us to maintain a high-quality rental fleet and provide additional product support to our end users. Service Support. We provide maintenance and repair services for our customers&#8217; owned equipment and to our own rental fleet. In addition to repair and maintenance on an as-needed or scheduled basis, we provide ongoing preventative maintenance services and warranty repairs for our customers. We devote significant resources to training our technical service employees and over time, we have built a full-scale services infrastructure that we believe would be difficult for companies without the requisite resources and lead time to effectively replicate. In addition to our principal business activities mentioned above, we provide ancillary equipment support activities including transportation, hauling, parts shipping and loss damage waivers.Sales and MarketingWe have two distinct, focused sales forces&#59; one specializing in equipment rentals and one focused specifically on new and used equipment sales. We believe maintaining separate sales forces for equipment rental and equipment sales is important to our customer service, allowing us to effectively meet the demands of different types of customers.Both our rental sales force and equipment sales force are divided into smaller, product focused teams which enhances the development of in-depth product application and technical expertise. To further develop knowledge and experience, we provide our sales forces with extensive training, including frequent factory and in-house training by manufacturer representatives regarding the operational features, operator safety training and maintenance of new equipment. This training is essential, as our sales personnel regularly call on customers&#8217; job sites, often assisting customers in assessing their immediate and ongoing equipment needs. In addition, we have a commission-based compensation program for our sales forces.We maintain a company-wide customer relationship management system. We believe that this comprehensive customer and sales management tool enhances our territory management program by increasing the productivity and efficiency of our sales representatives and branch managers as they are provided real-time access to sales and customer information.We have developed strategies to identify target customers for our equipment services in all markets. These strategies allow our sales force to identify frequent rental users, function as advisors and problem solvers for our customers and accelerate the sales process in new operations.While our specialized, well-trained sales force strengthens our customer relationships and fosters customer loyalty, we also promote our business through marketing and advertising, including industry publications, direct mail campaigns, television, the Yellow Pages and our Company website at www.he-equipment.com .&#160;Our Competitive StrengthsIntegrated Platform of Products and Services. We believe that our operating experience and the extensive infrastructure we have developed through years of operating as an integrated equipment services company provides us with a competitive advantage over rental-focused companies and equipment distributors. Key strengths of our integrated equipment services platform include: &#160;&#8226; ability to strengthen customer relationships by providing a full-range of products and services&#59; &#160;&#8226; purchasing power gained through purchases for our new equipment sales and rental operations&#59; &#160;&#8226; high quality rental fleet supported by our strong product support capabilities&#59; &#160;&#8226; established retail sales network resulting in profitable disposal of our used equipment&#59; and &#160;&#8226; mix of business activities that enables us to effectively operate through economic cycles. Complementary, High Margin Parts and Services Operations. Our parts and services businesses allow us to maintain our rental fleet in excellent condition and to offer our customers high-quality rental equipment. Our after-market parts and services businesses together provide us with a high-margin revenue source that has proven to be relatively stable throughout a range of economic cycles. High-Quality, Multipurpose Fleet. Our focus on four core types of heavy construction and industrial equipment allows us to better provide the specialized knowledge and support that our customers demand when renting and purchasing equipment. These four types of equipment are attractive because they have a long useful life, high residual value and generally strong industry demand. Well-Developed Infrastructure. We have built an infrastructure that as of February 10, 2021 included a network of 97 full-service facilities in 23 states. Our workforce included, as of December 31, 2020, a highly-skilled group of approximately 505 service technicians and an aggregate of 280 sales people in our specialized rental and equipment sales forces. We believe that our well-developed infrastructure helps us to better serve large multi-regional customers than our historically rental-focused competitors and provides an advantage when competing for lucrative fleet and project management business as well as the ability to quickly capitalize on new opportunities. Leading Distributor for Suppliers. We are a leading U.S. distributor for nationally-recognized equipment suppliers, including JLG Industries, Gehl, Genie Industries (Terex), Komatsu, Takeuchi and JCB. In addition, we are the world&#8217;s largest distributor of Grove and Manitowoc crane equipment. These relationships improve our ability to negotiate equipment acquisition pricing and allow us to purchase parts at wholesale costs. Customized Information Technology Systems. Our information systems allow us to actively manage our business and our rental fleet. We have a customer relationship management system that provides our sales force with real-time access to customer and sales information. In addition, our enterprise resource planning system enhances our ability to provide more timely and meaningful information to manage our business. Strong Customer Relationships. We have a diverse base of approximately 45,400 customers as of December 31, 2020 who we believe value our high level of service, knowledge and expertise. Our customer base includes a wide range of industrial and commercial companies, construction contractors, manufacturers, public utilities, municipalities, maintenance contractors and numerous and diverse other large industrial accounts. Our branches enable us to closely service local and regional customers, while our well-developed full-service infrastructure enables us to effectively service multi-regional and national accounts. We believe that our expansive presence and commitment to superior service at all levels of the organization is a key differentiator to many of our competitors. As a result, we spend a significant amount of time and resources to train all key personnel to be responsive and deliver high quality customer service and well-maintained equipment so that we can maintain and grow our customer relationships. Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team is led by Bradley W. Barber, our Chief Executive Officer, who has over 26 years of industry experience. Our senior and regional managers have approximately 25 years on average of industry experience. Our branch managers have extensive knowledge and industry experience as well. Our Business StrategyOur business strategy includes, among other things, managing the life cycle of our rental equipment, expanding our rental product offerings, increasing the availability of our product offerings through branch expansion, and pursuing selective acquisitions. However, the timing and extent to which we implement these various aspects of our strategy depend on a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control, such as general economic conditions and construction activity in the U.S.Managing the Life Cycle of Our Rental Equipment. We actively manage the size, quality, age and composition of our rental fleet, employing a &#8220;cradle through grave&#8221; approach. During the life of our rental equipment, we (1) aggressively negotiate on purchase price&#59; (2) use our customized information technology systems to closely monitor and analyze, among other things, time utilization (equipment usage based on customer demand), rental rate trends and pricing optimization and equipment demand&#59; (3) continuously adjust our fleet mix and pricing&#59; (4) maintain fleet quality through regional quality control managers and our on-site parts and services support&#59; and (5) dispose of rental equipment through our retail sales force. This allows us to purchase our rental equipment at competitive prices, optimally utilize our fleet, cost-effectively maintain our equipment quality and maximize the value of our equipment at the end of its useful life. Expanding our Rental Product Offerings . We intend to expand our product offerings to customers by offering specialty rental product solutions. Recently, we introduced trench safety product solutions in selected markets. We expect to expand these specialty rental offerings throughout our geographic footprint. Specialty rental product offerings typically provide higher margin opportunities than general rental products. Increasing the Availability of our Product Offerings through Branch Expansion . We intend to expand our network of branch locations, thereby increasing the availability of both general rental and specialty rental products to our customers to meet their specific needs. Our branch expansion strategy focuses on expanding in markets where we have a presence and benefit from name and brand recognition. Expanding our branch network allows us to grow our margins and improve Company profitability through revenue mix and by leveraging our fixed costs. Pursuing Selective Acquisitions. We intend to continue to evaluate and pursue, on an opportunistic basis, acquisitions that meet our selection criteria, including favorable financing terms, with the objective of increasing our revenues, improving our profitability, and strengthening our competitive position. We are focused on identifying and acquiring rental companies, including general rental and specialty rental companies, to complement our existing business, broaden our geographic footprint, and increase our density in existing markets, as well enter new markets where feasible expansion opportunities may exist. Growth through acquisitions allows us to leverage our fixed costs and grow profitability. We have completed three acquisitions over the last three years. Effective January 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Contractors Equipment Center, LLC (&#8220;CEC&#8221;), an equipment rental company serving the greater Denver, Colorado area with three branch locations, for approximately $132.4 million in cash. Effective April 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Rental Inc., an equipment rental company with five branch locations in Alabama and Florida, for approximately $68.6 million in cash. Effective February 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Cobra Equipment Rentals, LLC, dba We-Rent-It (&#8220;WRI&#8221;), a central Texas based non-residential construction-focused equipment rental company with six branch locations for approximately $107.9 million in cash. CustomersWe serve approximately 45,400 customers in the United States, primarily in the Intermountain, Southwest, Gulf Coast, West Coast, Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. Our customers include a wide range of industrial and commercial companies, construction contractors, manufacturers, public utilities, municipalities, maintenance contractors and numerous and diverse other large industrial accounts. They vary from small, single machine owners to large contractors and industrial and commercial companies who typically operate under equipment and maintenance budgets. Our branches enable us to closely service local and regional customers, while our well-developed full-service infrastructure enables us to effectively service multi-regional and national accounts. Our integrated strategy enables us to satisfy customer requirements and increase revenues from customers through cross-selling opportunities presented by the various products and services that we offer. As a result, our five reporting segments generally derive their revenue from the same customer base. In 2020, no single customer accounted for more than 0.9% of our total revenues, and no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue on a segmented basis. Our top ten customers combined accounted for approximately 5.8% of our total revenues in 2020.SuppliersWe purchase a significant amount of equipment from the same manufacturers with whom we have distribution agreements. We purchased approximately 51% of our new equipment and rental fleet from five manufacturers (Grove\/Manitowoc, Komatsu, Takeuchi, JCB, and Genie Industries (Terex)) during the year ended December 31, 2020. These relationships improve our ability to negotiate equipment acquisition pricing. Additionally, we are also a leading U.S. distributor for nationally-recognized equipment suppliers including JLG Industries, Gehl, Yanmar and John Deere. As an authorized distributor for a wide range of suppliers, we are also able to provide our customers parts and services that in many cases are covered under the manufacturer&#8217;s warranty. While we believe that we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment we purchase in each of our principal product categories, termination of one or more of our relationships with any of our major suppliers of equipment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations if we were unable to obtain adequate or timely rental and sales equipment. Competition The equipment industry is generally comprised of either pure rental equipment companies or manufacturer dealer\/distributorship companies. We are an integrated equipment services company and rent, sell and provide parts and services support. Although there has been some consolidation within the equipment industry in recent years, including the recent acquisitions of Rental Services Corporation, NES Rentals and Neff Corporation by URI, the equipment industry remains highly fragmented and consists mainly of a small number of multi-location regional or national operators and a large number of relatively small, independent businesses serving discrete local markets. Many of the markets in which we operate are served by numerous competitors, ranging from national and multi-regional equipment rental companies (for example, URI, Sunbelt Rentals and Hertz Equipment Rental) or equipment dealers (for example, Finning and Toromont) to small, independent businesses with a limited number of locations.We believe that participants in the equipment rental industry generally compete on the basis of availability, quality, reliability, delivery and price. In general, large operators enjoy substantial competitive advantages over small, independent rental businesses due to a distinct price advantage. Many rental equipment companies&#8217; parts and services offerings are limited and may prove difficult to expand due to the training, infrastructure and management resources necessary to develop the breadth of service offerings and depth of knowledge our service technicians are able to provide. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do.Traditionally, equipment manufacturers distributed their equipment and parts through a network of independent dealers with distribution agreements. As a result of consolidation and competition, both manufacturers and distributors sought to streamline their operations, improve their costs and gain market share. Our established, integrated infrastructure enables us to compete directly with our competitors on either a local, regional or national basis. We believe customers place greater emphasis on value-added services, teaming with equipment rental and sales companies who can meet all of their equipment, parts and services needs.SeasonalityAlthough our business is not significantly impacted by seasonality, the demand for our rental equipment tends to be lower in the winter months. The level of equipment rental activities is directly related to commercial and industrial construction and maintenance activities. Therefore, equipment rental performance will be correlated to the levels of current construction activities. The severity of weather conditions can have a temporary impact on the level of construction activities.Equipment sales cycles are also subject to some seasonality with the peak selling period occurring during the spring season and extending through the summer. Parts and services activities are less affected by changes in demand caused by seasonality.Environmental and Safety RegulationsOur facilities and operations are subject to comprehensive and frequently changing federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws. These laws regulate (1) the handling, storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and, if any, the associated cleanup of properties affected by pollutants&#59; (2) air quality (emissions)&#59; and (3) wastewater. We do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or competitive position as a result of our efforts to comply with such requirements. Although we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental requirements, we do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls or compliance.In the future, federal, state or local governments could enact new or more stringent laws or issue new or more stringent regulations concerning environmental and worker health and safety matters, or effect a change in their enforcement of existing laws or regulations, that could affect our operations. Also, in the future, contamination may be found to exist at our facilities or off-site locations where we have sent wastes. There can be no assurance that we, or various environmental regulatory agencies, will not discover previously unknown environmental non-compliance or contamination. We could be held liable for such newly-discovered non-compliance or contamination. It is possible that changes in environmental and worker health and safety laws or liabilities from newly-discovered non-compliance or contamination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Human CapitalH&#38;E&#8217;s operating philosophy is that our growth and continued success are the result of management and employees working together in a spirit of cooperation and teamwork. Our core values emphasize an environment where safety, diversity, inclusion, talent development, training and retention are top priorities. We believe this has enabled us to meet various challenges over the years, and the progress that has been achieved by us reflects this strong mutual commitment between the Company and its employees. We believe our employees are our greatest asset. We remain focused on furnishing friendly and safe working conditions, providing competitive pay and offering quality benefits, and producing revenue for the continued growth of the Company and the communities in which we operate, with an emphasis on the welfare of our employees and their families. We realize our success is a direct result of the hard work and dedication of our employees. Each employee at H&#38;E is a contributing partner in our future growth and we strive to maintain a mutually beneficial workplace culture that also fosters the professional development of each employee . As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,254 employees. Of these employees, 824 are salaried personnel and 1,430 are hourly personnel. Our employees perform the following functions: sales operations, parts operations, rental operations, technical services and office and administrative support. A collective bargaining agreement relating to two branch locations covers approximately 72 of our employees. We believe our relations with our employees are good, and we have never experienced a work stoppage.Generally, the total number of employees does not significantly fluctuate throughout the year. However, acquisition activity or the opening of new branches may increase the number of our employees or fluctuations in the level of our business activity could require some staffing level adjustments in response to actual or anticipated customer demand.Available InformationWe file electronically with the SEC annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Business Trust OverviewGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (formerly known as Bitcoin Investment Trust) (the &#8220;Trust&#8221;) is a Delaware Statutory Trust that was formed on September 13, 2013 by the filing of the Certificate of Trust with the Delaware Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. On January 11, 2019, the Trust changed its name from Bitcoin Investment Trust to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) by filing a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Trust with the Delaware Secretary of State. The Trust&#8217;s purpose is to hold Bitcoins, which are digital assets that are created and transmitted through the operations of the peer-to-peer Bitcoin Network, a decentralized network of computers that operates on cryptographic protocols. The Trust issues common units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (&#8220;Shares&#8221;), which represent ownership in the Trust, on a periodic basis to certain &#8220;accredited investors&#8221; within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;) in exchange for deposits of Bitcoin. The Shares are quoted on OTC Markets Group Inc.&#8217;s OTCQX&#174; Best Marketplace (&#8220;OTCQX&#8221;) under the ticker symbol &#8220;GBTC.&#8221; Grayscale Investments, LLC is the sponsor of the Trust (the &#8220;Sponsor&#8221;), Delaware Trust Company is the trustee of the Trust (the &#8220;Trustee&#8221;), Continental Stock Transfer &#38; Trust Company is the transfer agent of the Trust (in such capacity, the &#8220;Transfer Agent&#8221;) and the administrator of the Trust and Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC is the custodian of the Trust (the &#8220;Custodian&#8221;). The Trust issues Shares only in one or more blocks of 100 Shares (a block of 100 Shares is called a &#8220;Basket&#8221;) to certain authorized participants (&#8220;Authorized Participants&#8221;) from time to time. Baskets are offered in exchange for Bitcoins. At this time, the Sponsor is not operating a redemption program for the Shares and therefore Shares are not redeemable by the Trust. Due to the lack of an ongoing redemption program as well as price volatility, trading volume and closings of Digital Asset Exchanges due to fraud, failure, security breaches or otherwise, there can be no assurance that the value of the Shares will reflect the value of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities, and the Shares may trade at a substantial premium over, or a substantial discount to, the value of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities. The U.S. dollar value of a Basket of Shares at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the trade date of a creation order is equal to the Basket Amount, which is the number of Bitcoins required to create a Basket of Shares, multiplied by the &#8220;Index Price,&#8221; which is the volume-weighted index price of a Bitcoin in U.S. dollars calculated by applying a weighting algorithm to the price and trading volume data for the immediately preceding 24-hour period as of 4:00 p.m., New York time derived from the selected Digital Asset Exchanges that are reflected in the TradeBlock XBX Index (the &#8220;Index&#8221;) on such trade date. The Index Price is calculated using non-GAAP methodology and is not used in the Trust&#8217;s financial statements. See &#8220;&#8212;Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and Market&#8212;Bitcoin Value&#8212;The Index and the Index Price.&#8221; The Basket Amount is determined by dividing (x) the number of Bitcoins owned by the Trust at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on such trade date, after deducting the number of Bitcoins representing the U.S. dollar value of accrued but unpaid fees and expenses of the Trust (converted using the Index Price at such time, and carried to the eighth decimal place), by (y) the number of Shares outstanding at such time (with the quotient so obtained calculated to one one-hundred-millionth of one Bitcoin (i.e., carried to the eighth decimal place)), and multiplying such quotient by 100.The Shares are neither interests in nor obligations of the Sponsor or the Trustee. The Sponsor maintains an Internet website at www.grayscale.co\/bitcoin-trust\/, through which the registrant&#8217;s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are made available free of charge after they have been filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). Additional information regarding the Trust may also be found on the SEC&#8217;s EDGAR database at www.sec.gov. Trust Objective and Key Operating MetricsThe investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares (based on Bitcoin per Share) to reflect the value of the Bitcoin held by the Trust, determined by reference to the Index Price, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities. To date, the Trust has not met its investment objective and the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of Bitcoin held by the Trust, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities, but have instead traded at a premium over such value, which at times has been substantial. Recently, there have also been limited instances where the Shares have traded at a discount. In the event the Shares trade at a substantial premium, investors who purchase Shares on OTCQX will pay substantially more for their Shares than investors who purchase Shares in the private placement. The value of the Shares may not reflect the value of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities, for a variety of reasons, including the holding period under Rule 144 for Shares purchased in the private placement, the lack of an ongoing redemption program, any halting of creations by the Trust, Bitcoin price volatility, trading volumes on, or closures of, exchanges where digital assets trade due to fraud, failure, security breaches or otherwise, and the non-current trading hours between OTCQX and the global exchange market for trading Bitcoin. As a result, the &#160;Shares may continue to trade at a substantial premium over, or a substantial discount to, the value of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin , less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities, and the Trust may be unable to meet its investment objective for the foreseeable future. For example, from May 5, 2015 to December 31, 2020, the maximum premium of the closing price of the Shares quoted on OTCQX over the value of the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share was 142% and the average premium was 37%. Moreover, the closing price of the Shares as, quoted on OTCQX at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on each business day, has only been quoted at a discount on October 28, 2015. The discount on that day was 0.1%. As of December 31, 2020, the Trust&#8217;s Shares were quoted on OTCQX at a premium of 17% to the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share.While an investment in the Shares is not a direct investment in Bitcoin, the Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to gain investment exposure to Bitcoin. A substantial direct investment in Bitcoin may require expensive and sometimes complicated arrangements in connection with the acquisition, security and safekeeping of the Bitcoin and may involve the payment of substantial fees to acquire such Bitcoin from third-party facilitators through cash payments of U.S. dollars. Because the value of the Shares is correlated with the value of the Bitcoin held by the Trust, it is important to understand the investment attributes of, and the market for, Bitcoin.Shares purchased in the private placement are restricted securities that may not be resold except in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act and state securities laws and any such transaction must be approved in advance by the Sponsor. In determining whether to grant approval, the Sponsor will specifically look at whether the conditions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, including the requisite holding period thereunder, and any other applicable laws have been met. Any attempt to sell the Shares without the approval of the Sponsor in its sole discretion will be void ab initio. See &#8220; &#8212; Description of the Shares&#8212;Transfer Restrictions&#8221; for more information.Pursuant to Rule 144, the minimum holding period for Shares purchased in the private placement is six months. The Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins are carried, for financial stat ement purposes, at fair value, as required by the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). The Trust determines the fair value of Bitcoins based on the price provided by the Digital Asset Market that the Trust considers its principal market as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. The net asset value of the Trust determined on a GAAP basis is referred to in this Annual Report as &#8220;NAV.&#8221; See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#8212;Principal Market and Fair Value Determination&#8221; for more information on the Trust&#8217;s principal market selection. The Trust uses the Index Price to calculate its &#8220;Digital Asset Holdings,&#8221; which is the aggregate value, expressed in U.S. dollars, of the Trust&#8217;s assets (other than U.S. dollars, other fiat currency, Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency), less the U.S. dollar value of the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities calculated in the manner set forth under &#8220;&#8212;Valuation of Bitcoin and Determination of the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings.&#8221; &#8220;Digital Asset Holdings per Share&#8221; is calculated by dividing Digital Asset Holdings by the number of Shares currently outstanding. Digital Asset Holdings and Digital Asset Holdings per Share are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Digital Asset Holdings is not intended to be a substitute for the Trust&#8217;s NAV calculated in accordance with GAAP, and Digital Asset Holdings per Share is not intended to be a substitute for the Trust&#8217;s NAV per Share calculated in accordance with GAAP.At this time, the Trust is not operating a redemption program for Shares and therefore Shares are not redeemable by the Trust. In addition, the Trust may halt creations for extended periods of time for a variety of &#160; reasons, including in connection with forks, airdrops and other similar occurrences . As a result of these factors in addition to the holding period under Rule 144, Authorized Participants are not able to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities created when the market value of the Shares deviates from the value of the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share, which may cause the Shares to trade at a substantial premium over, or substantial discount to, the value of the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share. Subject to receipt of regulatory approval from the SEC and approval by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, the Trust may in the future operate a redemption program. Because the Trust does not believe that the SEC would, at this time, entertain an application for the waiver of rules needed in order to operate an ongoing redemption program, the Trust currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval from the SEC to operate an ongoing redemption program. Even if such relief is sought in the future, no assurance can be given as to the timing of such relief or that such relief will be granted. If such relief is granted and the Sponsor approves a redemption program, the Shares will be redeemable in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and the relevant Participant Agreement. Although the Sponsor cannot predict with certainty what effect, if any, the operation of a redemption program would have on the trading price of the Shares, a redemption program would allow Authorized Participants to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities created when the market value of the Shares deviates from the value of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities, which may have the effect of reducing any premium at which the Shares trade on OTCQX over such value or cause the Shares to trade at a discount to such value from time to time.&#160;For a discussion of risks relating to the deviation in the trading price of the Shares from the Digital Asset Holdings per Share, see &#8220; Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; Risk Factors Related to the Trust and the Shares&#8212;Because of the holding period under Rule 144, the lack of an ongoing redemption program and the Trust&#8217;s ability to halt creations from time to time, there is no arbitrage mechanism to keep the price of the Shares closely linked to the Index Price and the Shares have historically traded at a substantial premium over the Digital Asset Holdings per Share,&#8221; &#8220; Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; Risk Factors Related to Digital Assets&#8212;The trading prices of many digital assets, including B itcoin , have experienced extreme volatility in recent periods and may continue to do so. Extreme volatility in the future, including further declines in the trading prices of B itcoin , could have a material adverse effect on the value of the Shares and the Shares could lose all or substantially all of their value,&#8221; &#8220; Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; Risk Factors Related to Digital Assets&#8212;The value of the Shares relates directly to the value of B itcoin , the value of which may be highly volatile and subject to fluctuations due to a number of factors,&#8221; &#8220; Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; Risk Factors Related to Digital Assets&#8212;Due to the unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of Digital Asset Exchanges, they may experience fraud, security failures or operational problems, which may adversely affect the value of B itcoin and, consequently, the value of the Shares&#8221; and &#8220; Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; Risk Factors Related to the Trust and the Shares&#8212;The Shares may trade at a price that is at, above or below the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share as a result of the non-current trading hours between OTCQX and the Digital Asset Exchange Market.&#8221; Characteristics of the Shares The Shares are intended to offer investors an opportunity to participate in Digital Asset Markets through an investment in securities. As of December 31, 2020, each Share represented approximately 0.0010 of one Bitcoin. The logistics of accepting, transferring and safekeeping of Bitcoins are dealt with by the Sponsor and Custodian, and the related expenses are built into the price of the Shares. Therefore, shareholders do not have additional tasks or costs over and above those generally associated with investing in any other privately placed security. The Shares have certain other key characteristics, including the following: &#160;&#8226; Easily Accessible and Relatively Cost Efficient . Investors in the Shares can also directly access the Digital Asset Markets. The Sponsor believes that investors will be able to more effectively implement strategic and tactical asset allocation strategies that use Bitcoins by using the Shares instead of directly purchasing and holding Bitcoins, and for many investors, transaction costs related to the Shares will be lower than those associated with the direct purchase, storage and safekeeping of Bitcoins. &#160;&#8226; Market-Traded and Transparent . The Shares are quoted on OTCQX. Shareholders that purchased Shares directly from the Trust and have held them for the requisite holding period under Rule 144 may sell their Shares on OTCQX upon receiving approval from the Sponsor. Investors may also choose to purchase Shares on OTCQX. Shares purchased on OTCQX are not restricted. The Sponsor believes the quotation of the Shares on OTCQX provides investors with an efficient means to implement various investment strategies. The Trust will not hold or employ any derivative securities. Furthermore, the value of the Trust&#8217;s assets will be reported each day on https:\/\/grayscale.co\/bitcoin-trust\/#market-performance. &#160;&#8226; Minimal Credit Risk . The Shares represent an interest in actual Bitcoins owned by the Trust. The Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins are not subject to borrowing arrangements with third parties or to counterparty or credit risks. This contrasts with the other financial products such as CoinShares exchange-traded notes, TeraExchange swaps and Bitcoin futures and options traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (&#8220;CME&#8221;) and the Intercontinental Exchange (&#8220;ICE&#8221;) through which investors gain exposure to digital assets through the use of derivatives that are subject to counterparty and credit risks. &#160;&#8226; Safekeeping System . The Custodian has been appointed to control and secure the Bitcoins for the Trust using offline storage, or cold storage, mechanisms to secure the Trust&#8217;s private key &#8220;shards&#8221;. The hardware, software, administration and continued technological development that are used by the Custodian may not be available or cost-effective for many investors. The Trust differentiates itself from competing digital asset financial vehicles, to the extent that such digital asset financial vehicles may develop, in the following ways: &#160;&#8226; Custodian . The Custodian that holds the private key shards associated with the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins is Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC. Other digital asset financial vehicles that use cold storage may not use a custodian to hold their private keys. &#160;&#8226; Cold Storage of Private Keys . The private key shards associated with the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins are kept in cold storage, which means that the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins are disconnected and\/or deleted entirely from the internet. See &#8220;&#8212;Custody of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins&#8221; for more information relating to the storage and retrieval of the Trust&#8217;s private keys to and from cold storage. Other digital asset financial vehicles may not utilize cold storage or may utilize less effective cold storage-related hardware and security protocols. &#160;&#160;&#8226; Location of Private Vaults . Private key shards associated with the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins are distributed geographically by the Custodian in secure vaults around the world, including in the United States. The locations of the secure vaults may change regularly and are kept confidential by the Custodian for security purposes. &#160;&#8226; Enhanced Security . Transfers from the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Account require certain security procedures, including but not limited to, multiple encrypted private key shards, usernames, passwords and 2-step verification. Multiple private key shards held by the Custodian must be combined to reconstitute the private key to sign any transaction in order to transfer the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins. Private key shards are distributed geographically in secure vaults around the world, including in the United States. As a result, if any one secure vault is ever compromised, this event will have no impact on the ability of the Trust to access its assets, other than a possible delay in operations, while one or more of the other secure vaults is used instead. These security procedures are intended to remove single points of failure in the protection of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins. &#160;&#8226; Custodian Audits . The Custodian has agreed to allow the Trust and the Sponsor to take any necessary steps to verify that satisfactory internal control system and procedures are in place, and to visit and inspect the systems on which the Custodian&#8217;s coins are held. &#160;&#8226; Directly Held Bitcoins . The Trust directly owns actual Bitcoins held through the Custodian. The direct ownership of Bitcoins is not subject to counterparty or credit risks. This may differ from other digital asset financial vehicles that provide Bitcoin exposure through other means, such as the use of financial or derivative instruments. &#160;&#8226; Sponsor&#8217;s Fee . The Sponsor&#8217;s Fee is a competitive factor that may influence the value of the Shares. Activities of the Trust The activities of the Trust are limited to (i) issuing Baskets in exchange for Bitcoins transferred to the Trust as consideration in connection with the creations, (ii) transferring or selling Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency as necessary to cover the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee and\/or any Additional Trust Expenses, (iii) transferring Bitcoins in exchange for Baskets surrendered for redemption (subject to obtaining regulatory approval from the SEC and approval from the Sponsor), (iv) causing the Sponsor to sell Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency on the termination of the Trust, (v) making distributions of Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency or cash from the sale thereof and (vi) engaging in all administrative and security procedures necessary to accomplish such activities in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement, the Custodian Agreement, the Index License Agreement and the Participant Agreements. In addition, the Trust may engage in any lawful activity necessary or desirable in order to facilitate shareholders&#8217; access to Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency, provided that such activities do not conflict with the terms of the Trust Agreement. The Trust will not be actively managed. It will not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or to ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the market prices of Bitcoins.Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency From time to time, the Trust may come into possession of Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency by virtue of its ownership of Bitcoins, generally through a fork in the Bitcoin Blockchain, an airdrop offered to holders of Bitcoins or other similar event. Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust may take any lawful action necessary or desirable in connection with the Trust&#8217;s ownership of Incidental Rights, including the acquisition of IR Virtual Currency, unless such action would adversely affect the status of the Trust as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise be prohibited by the Trust Agreement. These actions include (i) selling Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency and distributing the cash proceeds to shareholders, (ii) distributing Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency in-kind to the shareholders or to an agent acting on behalf of the shareholders for sale by such agent if an in-kind distribution would otherwise be infeasible and (iii) irrevocably abandoning Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency. The Trust may also use Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency to pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee and Additional Trust Expenses, if any, as discussed below under &#8220;&#8212;Expenses&#59; Sales of Bitcoins.&#8221; However, the Trust does not expect to take any Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency it may hold into account for purposes of determining the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings, the Digital Asset Holdings per Share, the NAV and the NAV per Share. With respect to any fork, airdrop or similar event, the Sponsor may, in its discretion, decide to cause the Trust to distribute the Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency in-kind to an agent of the shareholders for resale by such agent, or to irrevocably abandon the Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency. In the case of a distribution in-kind to an agent acting on behalf of the shareholders, the shareholders&#8217; agent will attempt to sell the Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency, and if the agent is able to do so, will remit the cash proceeds to shareholders, net of expenses and any applicable withholding taxes. There can be no assurance as to the price or prices for any Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency that the agent may realize, and the value of the Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency may increase or decrease after any sale by the agent. In the case of abandonment of Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency, the Trust would not receive any direct or indirect consideration for the Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency and thus the value of the Shares will not reflect the value of the Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency. &#160;On May 2, 2018 and July 29, 2019 , the Sponsor delivered to the former custodian and the current Custodian, respectively , on behalf of the Trust, a notice ( each a &#8220;Prospective Abandonment Notice , &#8221; and collectively, the &#8220;Prospective Abandonment Notices&#8221; ) stating that the Trust is abandoning irrevocably for no direct or indirect consideration, effective immediately prior to each time at which the Trust creates Shares ( any such time, a &#8220;Creation Time&#8221;), all Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency to which it would otherwise be entitled as of such time (any such abandonment a &#8220;Pre-Creation Abandonment&#8221;) &#59; provided that a Pre-Creation Abandonment will not apply to any Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency if (i) the Trust has taken , or is taking at such time, an &#8220;Affirmative Action&#8221; to acquire or abandon such Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency at any time prior to such Creation Time or (ii) such Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency has been subject to a previous Pre-Creation Abandonment. An Affirmative Action refers to a written notification from the Sponsor to the Custodian of the Trust&#8217;s intention (i) to acquire and\/or retain an Incidental Rights and \/or IR Virtual Currency or (ii) to abandon, with effect prior to the relevant Creation Time, an Incidental Rights and \/or IR Virtual Currency . In determining whether to take an Affirmative Action to acquire and\/or retain an Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency, the Trust takes into consideration a number of factors, including: &#160;&#8226; the Custodian&#8217;s agreement to provide access to the IR Virtual Currency&#59; &#160;&#8226; the availability of a safe and practical way to custody the IR Virtual Currency&#59; &#160;&#8226; the costs of taking possession and\/or maintaining ownership of the IR Virtual Currency and whether such costs exceed the benefits of owning such IR Virtual Currency&#59; &#160;&#8226; whether there are any legal restrictions on, or tax implications with respect to, the ownership, sale or disposition of the Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency, regardless of whether there is a safe and practical way to custody and secure such Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency&#59; &#160;&#8226; the existence of a suitable market into which the Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency may be sold&#59; and &#160;&#8226; whether the Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency is, or may be, a security under federal securities laws. In determining whether the IR Virtual Currency is, or may be, a security under federal securities laws, the Sponsor takes into account a number of factors, including the definition of a &#8220;security&#8221; under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act, SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946) and the case law interpreting it, as well as reports, orders, press releases, public statements and speeches by the SEC providing guidance on when a digital asset is a &#8220;security&#8221; for purposes of the federal securities laws. As a result of the Prospective Abandonment Notices, since May 2, 2018, the Trust has irrevocably abandoned, prior to the Creation Time of any Shares, any Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency that it may have any right to receive at such time. The Trust has also abandoned Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency through Affirmative Actions. The Trust has no right to receive any Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency abandoned pursuant to either the Prospective Abandonment Notices or Affirmative Actions. Furthermore, the Custodian has no authority, pursuant to the Custodian Agreement or otherwise, to exercise, obtain or hold, as the case may be, any such abandoned Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency on behalf of the Trust or to transfer any such abandoned Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency to the Trust if the Trust terminates its custodial arrangement with the Custodian. The Sponsor intends to evaluate each fork, airdrop or similar occurrence on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the Trust&#8217;s legal advisors, tax consultants, and Custodian, and may decide to abandon any Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency resulting from a hard fork, airdrop or similar occurrence should the Sponsor conclude, in its discretion, that such abandonment is in the best interests of the Trust. Secondary Market Trading While the Trust&#8217;s investment objective is for the Shares (based on Bitcoin per Share) to reflect the value of the Bitcoin held by the Trust, determined by reference to the Index Price, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities, the Shares may trade in the Secondary Market on OTCQX (or on another Secondary Market in the future) at prices that are lower or higher than the Digital Asset Holdings per Share. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the Digital Asset Holdings per Share may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours and liquidity between OTCQX and larger Digital Asset Exchanges. While the Shares are listed and trade on OTCQX from 6:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m., New York time, liquidity in the Digital Asset Markets may fluctuate depending upon the volume and availability of larger Digital Asset Exchanges. As a result, during periods in which Digital Asset Market liquidity is limited or a major Digital Asset Exchange is off-line, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the Shares may widen . &#160;Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and Market Bitcoin is a digital asset that is created and transmitted through the operations of the peer-to-peer Bitcoin Network, a decentralized network of computers that operates on cryptographic protocols. No single entity owns or operates the Bitcoin Network, the infrastructure of which is collectively maintained by a decentralized user base. The Bitcoin Network allows people to exchange tokens of value, called Bitcoin, which are recorded on a public transaction ledger known as a Blockchain. Bitcoin can be used to pay for goods and services, or it can be converted to fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, at rates determined on Digital Asset Markets that trade Bitcoin or in individual end-user-to-end-user transactions under a barter system. The Bitcoin Network is decentralized and does not require governmental authorities or financial institution intermediaries to create, transmit or determine the value of Bitcoin. Rather, Bitcoin is created and allocated by the Bitcoin Network protocol through a &#8220;mining&#8221; process. The value of Bitcoin is determined by the supply of and demand for Bitcoin on the Digital Asset Markets or in private end-user-to-end-user transactions. New Bitcoin are created and rewarded to the miners of a block in the Blockchain for verifying transactions. The Blockchain is effectively a decentralized database that includes all blocks that have been mined by miners and it is updated to include new blocks as they are solved. Each Bitcoin transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin Network and, when included in a block, recorded in the Blockchain. As each new block records outstanding Bitcoin transactions, and outstanding transactions are settled and validated through such recording, the Blockchain represents a complete, transparent and unbroken history of all transactions of the Bitcoin Network. For further details, see &#8220;&#8212;Creation of New Bitcoin&#8221; below. History of Bitcoin The Bitcoin Network was initially contemplated in a white paper that also described Bitcoin and the operating software to govern the Bitcoin Network. The white paper was purportedly authored by Satoshi Nakamoto. However, no individual with that name has been reliably identified as Bitcoin&#8217;s creator, and the general consensus is that the name is a pseudonym for the actual inventor or inventors. The first Bitcoins were created in 2009 after Nakamoto released the Bitcoin Network source code (the software and protocol that created and launched the Bitcoin Network). The Bitcoin Network has been under active development since that time by a group of engineers known as core developers. Overview of the Bitcoin Network&#8217;s Operations In order to own, transfer or use Bitcoin directly on the Bitcoin Network (as opposed to through an intermediary, such as a custodian), a person generally must have internet access to connect to the Bitcoin Network. Bitcoin transactions may be made directly between end-users without the need for a third-party intermediary. To prevent the possibility of double-spending Bitcoin, a user must notify the Bitcoin Network of the transaction by broadcasting the transaction data to its network peers. The Bitcoin Network provides confirmation against double-spending by memorializing every transaction in the Blockchain, which is publicly accessible and transparent. This memorialization and verification against double-spending is accomplished through the Bitcoin Network mining process, which adds &#8220;blocks&#8221; of data, including recent transaction information, to the Blockchain. Brief Description of Bitcoin Transfers Prior to engaging in Bitcoin transactions directly on the Bitcoin Network, a user generally must first install on its computer or mobile device a Bitcoin Network software program that will allow the user to generate a private and public key pair associated with a Bitcoin address commonly referred to as a &#8220;wallet.&#8221; The Bitcoin Network software program and the Bitcoin address also enable the user to connect to the Bitcoin Network and transfer Bitcoin to, and receive Bitcoin from, other users. Each Bitcoin Network address, or wallet, is associated with a unique &#8220;public key&#8221; and &#8220;private key&#8221; pair. To receive Bitcoin, the Bitcoin recipient must provide its public key to the party initiating the transfer. This activity is analogous to a recipient for a transaction in U.S. dollars providing a routing address in wire instructions to the payor so that cash may be wired to the recipient&#8217;s account. The payor approves the transfer to the address provided by the recipient by &#8220;signing&#8221; a transaction that consists of the recipient&#8217;s public key with the private key of the address from where the payor is transferring the Bitcoin. The recipient, however, does not make public or provide to the sender its related private key. Neither the recipient nor the sender reveal their private keys in a transaction, because the private key authorizes transfer of the funds in that address to other users. Therefore, if a user loses his private key, the user may permanently lose access to the Bitcoin contained in the associated address. Likewise, Bitcoin is irretrievably lost if the private key associated with them is deleted and no backup has been made. When sending Bitcoin, a user&#8217;s Bitcoin Network software program must validate the transaction with the associated private key. The resulting digitally validated transaction is sent by the user&#8217;s Bitcoin Network software program to the Bitcoin Network to allow transaction confirmation. &#160;Some Bitcoin transactions are conducted &#8220;off-blockchain&#8221; and are therefore not recorded in the Blockchain. Some &#8220;off-blockchain transactions&#8221; involve the transfer of control over, or ownership of, a specific digital wallet holding Bitcoin or the reallocation of ownership of certain Bitcoin in a pooled-ownership digital wallet, such as a digital wallet owned by a Digital Asset Exchange. In contrast to on-blockchain transactions, which are publicly recorded on the Blockchain, information and data regarding off-blockchain transactions are generally not publicly available. Therefore, off-blockchain transactions are not truly Bitcoin transactions in that they do not involve the transfer of transaction data on the Bitcoin Network and do not reflect a movement of Bitcoin between addresses recorded in the Blockchain. For these reasons, off-blockchain transactions are subject to risks as any such transfer of Bitcoin ownership is not protected by the protocol behind the Bitcoin Network or recorded in, and validated through, the blockchain mechanism. Summary of a Bitcoin Transaction In a Bitcoin transaction directly on the Bitcoin Network between two parties (as opposed to through an intermediary, such as a custodian), the following circumstances must initially be in place: (i) the party seeking to send Bitcoin must have a Bitcoin Network public key, and the Bitcoin Network must recognize that public key as having sufficient Bitcoin for the transaction&#59; (ii) the receiving party must have a Bitcoin Network public key&#59; and (iii) the spending party must have internet access with which to send its spending transaction. The receiving party must provide the spending party with its public key and allow the Blockchain to record the sending of Bitcoin to that public key. After the provision of a recipient&#8217;s Bitcoin Network public key, the spending party must enter the address into its Bitcoin Network software program along with the number of Bitcoin to be sent. The number of Bitcoin to be sent will typically be agreed upon between the two parties based on a set number of Bitcoin or an agreed upon conversion of the value of fiat currency to Bitcoin. Since every computation on the Bitcoin Network requires the payment of Bitcoin, including verification and memorialization of Bitcoin transfers, there is a transaction fee involved with the transfer, which is based on computation complexity and not on the value of the transfer and is paid by the payor with a fractional number of Bitcoin. After the entry of the Bitcoin Network address, the number of Bitcoin to be sent and the transaction fees, if any, to be paid, will be transmitted by the spending party. The transmission of the spending transaction results in the creation of a data packet by the spending party&#8217;s Bitcoin Network software program, which is transmitted onto the decentralized Bitcoin Network, resulting in the distribution of the information among the software programs of users across the Bitcoin Network for eventual inclusion in the Blockchain. As discussed in greater detail below in &#8220;&#8212;Creation of New Bitcoin,&#8221; Bitcoin Network miners record transactions when they solve for and add blocks of information to the Blockchain. When a miner solves for a block, it creates that block, which includes data relating to (i) the solution to the block, (ii) a reference to the prior block in the Blockchain to which the new block is being added and (iii) transactions that have occurred but have not yet been added to the Blockchain. The miner becomes aware of outstanding, unrecorded transactions through the data packet transmission and distribution discussed above. Upon the addition of a block included in the Blockchain, the Bitcoin Network software program of both the spending party and the receiving party will show confirmation of the transaction on the Blockchain and reflect an adjustment to the Bitcoin balance in each party&#8217;s Bitcoin Network public key, completing the Bitcoin transaction. Once a transaction is confirmed on the Blockchain, it is irreversible. Creation of New Bitcoin New Bitcoins are created through the mining process as discussed below. The Bitcoin Network is kept running by computers all over the world. In order to incentivize those who incur the computational costs of securing the network by validating transactions, there is a reward that is given to the computer that was able to create the latest block on the chain. Every 10 minutes, on average, a new block is added to the Blockchain with the latest transactions processed by the network, and the computer that generated this block is currently awarded 6.25 Bitcoin. Due to the nature of the algorithm for block generation, this process (generating a &#8220;proof-of-work&#8221;) is guaranteed to be random. Over time, rewards are expected to be proportionate to the computational power of each machine. The process by which Bitcoin is &#8220;mined&#8221; results in new blocks being added to the Blockchain and new Bitcoin tokens being issued to the miners. Computers on the Bitcoin Network engage in a set of prescribed complex mathematical calculations in order to add a block to the Blockchain and thereby confirm Bitcoin transactions included in that block&#8217;s data. To begin mining, a user can download and run Bitcoin Network mining software, which turns the user&#8217;s computer into a &#8220;node&#8221; on the Bitcoin Network that validates blocks. Each block contains the details of some or all of the most recent transactions that are not memorialized in prior blocks, as well as a record of the award of Bitcoin to the miner who added the new block. Each unique block &#160;can be solved and added to the Blockchain by only one miner. Therefore, all individual miners and mining pools on the Bitcoin Network are engaged in a competitive process of constantly increasing their computing power to improve their likelihood of solving for new blocks. As more miners join the Bitcoin Network and its processing power increases, the Bitcoin Network adjusts the complexity of the block-solving equation to maintain a predetermined pace of adding a new block to the Blockchain approximately every ten minutes. A miner&#8217;s proposed block is added to the Blockchain once a majority of the nodes on the Bitcoin Network confirms the miner&#8217;s work. Miners that are successful in adding a block to the Blockchain are automatically awarded Bitcoin for their effort and may also receive transaction fees paid by transferors whose transactions are recorded in the block. This reward system is the method by which new Bitcoin enter into circulation to the public. The Bitcoin Network is designed in such a way that the reward for adding new blocks to the Blockchain decreases over time. Once new Bitcoin tokens are no longer awarded for adding a new block, miners will only have transaction fees to incentivize them, and as a result, it is expected that miners will need to be better compensated with higher transaction fees to ensure that there is adequate incentive for them to continue mining. Limits on Bitcoin Supply The supply of new Bitcoin is mathematically controlled so that the number of Bitcoin grows at a limited rate pursuant to a pre-set schedule. The number of Bitcoin awarded for solving a new block is automatically halved after every 210,000 blocks are added to the Blockchain. Currently, the fixed reward for solving a new block is 6.25 Bitcoin per block and this is expected to decrease by half to become 3.125 Bitcoin after the next 210,000 blocks have entered the Bitcoin Network, which is expected to be mid-2024. This deliberately controlled rate of Bitcoin creation means that the number of Bitcoin in existence will increase at a controlled rate until the number of Bitcoin in existence reaches the pre-determined 21 million Bitcoin. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 18.6 million Bitcoins were outstanding and the date when the 21 million Bitcoin limitation will be reached is estimated to be the year 2140. Modifications to the Bitcoin Protocol Bitcoin is an open source project with no official developer or group of developers that controls the Bitcoin Network. However, the Bitcoin Network&#8217;s development is overseen by a core group of developers. The core developers are able to access, and can alter, the Bitcoin Network source code and, as a result, they are responsible for quasi-official releases of updates and other changes to the Bitcoin Network&#8217;s source code. The release of updates to the Bitcoin Network&#8217;s source code does not guarantee that the updates will be automatically adopted. Users and miners must accept any changes made to the Bitcoin source code by downloading the proposed modification of the Bitcoin Network&#8217;s source code. A modification of the Bitcoin Network&#8217;s source code is effective only with respect to the Bitcoin users and miners that download it. If a modification is accepted by only a percentage of users and miners, a division in the Bitcoin Network will occur such that one network will run the pre-modification source code and the other network will run the modified source code. Such a division is known as a &#8220;fork.&#8221; See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risk Factors Related to Digital Assets&#8212;A temporary or permanent &#8220;fork&#8221; could adversely affect the value of the Shares.&#8221; Consequently, as a practical matter, a modification to the source code becomes part of the Bitcoin Network only if accepted by participants collectively having most of the processing power on the Bitcoin Network. In the past, there have been several forks in the Bitcoin Network, including, but not limited to, forks resulting in the creation of Bitcoin Cash (August 1, 2017), Bitcoin Gold (October 24, 2017) and Bitcoin SegWit2X (December 28, 2017), among others. Core development of the Bitcoin Network source code has increasingly focused on modifications of the Bitcoin Network protocol to increase speed and scalability and also allow for non-financial, next generation uses. For example, following the recent activation of Segregated Witness on the Bitcoin Network, an alpha version of the Lightning Network was released. The Lightning Network is an open-source decentralized network that enables instant off-Blockchain transfers of the ownership of Bitcoin without the need of a trusted third party. The system utilizes bidirectional payment channels that consist of multi-signature addresses. One on-Blockchain transaction is needed to open a channel and another on-Blockchain transaction can close the channel. Once a channel is open, value can be transferred instantly between counterparties, who are engaging in real Bitcoin transactions without broadcasting them to the Bitcoin Network. New transactions will replace previous transactions and the counterparties will store everything locally as long as the channel stays open to increase transaction throughput and reduce computational burden on the Bitcoin Network. Other efforts include increased use of smart contracts and distributed registers built into, built atop or pegged alongside the Blockchain. For example, the white paper for Blockstream, an organization that includes core developer Pieter Wuille, calls for the use of &#8220;pegged sidechains&#8221; to develop programming environments that are built within Blockchain ledgers that can interact with and rely on the security of the Bitcoin Network and Blockchain, while remaining independent from them. Open-source projects such as RSK are a manifestation of this concept and seek to create the first open-source, smart contract platform built on the Blockchain to enable automated, condition-based payments with increased speed and scalability. The Trust&#8217;s activities will not directly relate to such projects, though such projects may utilize Bitcoin as tokens for the facilitation of their non-financial uses, thereby potentially increasing demand for Bitcoin and the utility of the Bitcoin Network as a whole. Conversely, projects that operate and are built within the Blockchain may increase the data flow on the Bitcoin Network and could either &#8220;bloat&#8221; the size of the Blockchain or slow &#160;confirmation times. At this time, such projects remain in early stages and have not been materially integrated into the Blockchain or the Bitcoin Network. Bitcoin Value Digital Asset Exchange Valuation The value of Bitcoin is determined by the value that various market participants place on Bitcoin through their transactions. The most common means of determining the value of a Bitcoin is by surveying one or more Digital Asset Exchanges where Bitcoin is traded publicly and transparently (e.g., Bitstamp, Coinbase, Kraken and LMAX Digital ). Additionally, there are over-the-counter dealers or market makers that transact in Bitcoin. Digital Asset Exchange Public Market Data On each online Digital Asset Exchange, Bitcoin is traded with publicly disclosed valuations for each executed trade, measured by one or more fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar or euro. Over-the-counter dealers or market makers do not typically disclose their trade data. Currently, there are several Digital Asset Exchanges operating worldwide and online Digital Asset Exchanges represent a substantial percentage of Bitcoin buying and selling activity and provide the most data with respect to prevailing valuations of Bitcoins. These exchanges include established exchanges such as exchanges included in the Index which provide a number of options for buying and selling Bitcoins. The below table reflects the trading volume in Bitcoins and market share of the BTC-U.S. dollar trading pair of each of the Digital Asset Exchanges included in the Index as of December 31, 2020 using data reported by the Index Provider: Digital Asset Exchanges included in the Index as of December 31, 2020 (1)&#160;Volume (BTC)&#160;&#160;Market Share (2)&#160;Coinbase Pro&#160;&#160;25,031,227&#160;&#160;&#160;18.52%Bitstamp&#160;&#160;20,235,738&#160;&#160;&#160;14.97%Kraken&#160;&#160;9,096,303&#160;&#160;&#160;6.73%LMAX Digital&#160;&#160;3,267,645&#160;&#160;&#160;2.42%Total BTC-U.S. Dollar trading pair&#160;&#160;57,630,913&#160;&#160;&#160;42.64%&#160;(1) On January 15, 2019, the Index Provider added back Kraken and also added Bittrex to the Index. On January 19, 2020, the Index Provider removed Bittrex and added LMAX Digital as part of its scheduled quarterly review. On April 6, 2020, the Index Provider removed itBit and did not add any constituents as part of its scheduled quarterly review.(2) Market share is calculated using trading volume data (in Bitcoins) provided by the Index Provider for certain Digital Asset Exchanges, including Coinbase Pro, Bitstamp, Kraken, and LMAX Digital, as well as certain other large U.S.-dollar denominated Digital Asset Exchanges that are not currently included in the Index, including Binance.US (data included from April 1, 2020), Bitfinex, Bitflyer (data included from December 24, 2018), Bittrex (data included from July 31, 2018), ErisX (data included from October 1, 2020), Gemini, itBit, LakeBTC (data included from May 1, 2015 to June 1, 2018 and from January 27, 2019), HitBTC (data included from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020) and OKCoin. The domicile, regulation and legal compliance of the Digital Asset Exchanges included in the Index varies. Information regarding each Digital Asset Exchange may be found, where available, on the websites for such Digital Asset Exchanges, among other places.Although the Index is designed to accurately capture the market price of Bitcoin, third parties may be able to purchase and sell Bitcoin on public or private markets not included among the constituent Digital Asset Exchanges of the Index, and such transactions may take place at prices materially higher or lower than the Index Price. Moreover, there may be variances in the prices of Bitcoin on the various Digital Asset Exchanges, including as a result of differences in fee structures or administrative procedures on different Digital Asset Exchanges. For example, based on data provided by the Index Provider, on any given day during the year ended December 31, 2020, the maximum differential between the 4:00 p.m., New York time spot price of any single Digital Asset Exchange included in the Index and the Index Price was 14.21% and the average of the maximum differentials of the 4:00 p.m., New York time spot price of each Digital Asset Exchange included in the Index and the Index Price was 14.14%. During this same period, the average differential between the 4:00 p.m., New York time spot prices of all the Digital Asset Exchanges included in the Index and the Index Price was 0.18%. The timeframe chosen reflects the longest continuous period during which the Digital Asset Exchanges that are currently included in the Index have been constituents. All Digital Asset Exchanges that were included in the Index throughout the period were considered in this analysis. To the extent such prices differ materially from the Index Price, investors may lose confidence in the Shares&#8217; ability to track the market price of Bitcoin. &#160;The Index and the Index Price The Index is a U.S. dollar-denominated composite reference rate for the price of Bitcoin. The Index is designed to (1) mitigate the effects of fraud, manipulation and other anomalous trading activity from impacting the Bitcoin reference rate, (2) provide a real-time, volume-weighted fair value of Bitcoin and (3) appropriately handle and adjust for non-market related events. Constituent Exchange Selection The Index is designed to have limited exposure to interruption of individual Digital Asset Exchanges by collecting transaction data from top Digital Asset Exchanges in real-time and evaluating pricing data on a per-second basis. The Digital Asset Exchanges that are included in the Index are selected by the Index Provider utilizing a methodology that is guided by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (&#8220;IOSCO&#8221;) principles for financial benchmarks. For an exchange to become a Digital Asset Exchange included in the Index (a &#8220;Constituent Exchange&#8221;), it must satisfy the criteria listed below (the &#8220;Inclusion Criteria&#8221;): &#160;&#8226; Compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state licensing requirements and practices regarding Anti-Money Laundering (&#8220;AML&#8221;) and Know-Your-Customer (&#8220;KYC&#8221;) regulations (i.e., a U.S.-Compliant Exchange) &#160;&#8226; Publicly known ownership &#160;&#8226; No restrictions on deposits and\/or withdrawals of Bitcoin &#160;&#8226; No restrictions on deposits and\/or withdrawals of U.S. dollars &#160;&#8226; Reliably displays new trade prices and volumes on a real-time basis through APIs &#160;&#8226; Programmatic trading of the Bitcoin\/U.S. dollar spot price &#160;&#8226; Liquid market in the Bitcoin\/U.S. dollar spot price &#160;&#8226; Trading volume must represent a minimum of total Bitcoin\/U.S. dollar trading volumes (5% for U.S. exchanges and 10% non-U.S. exchanges) &#160;&#8226; Discretion of the Index Provider&#8217;s analysts A Digital Asset Exchange is removed from the Index when it no longer satisfies the Inclusion Criteria. The Index Provider does not currently include data from over-the-counter markets or derivatives platforms in the Index. Over-the-counter data is not currently included because of the potential for trades to include a significant premium or discount paid for larger liquidity, which creates an uneven comparison relative to more active markets. There is also a higher potential for over-the-counter transactions to not be arms-length, and thus not be representative of a true market price . Bitcoin derivative markets are also not currently included as the markets remain relatively thin. The Index Provider will consider IOSCO principles for financial benchmarks and the management of trading venues of Bitcoin derivatives when considering inclusion of over-the-counter or derivative platform data in the future.The Index Provider may change the trading venues that are used to calculate the Index or otherwise change the way in which the Index is calculated at any time. For example, the Index Provider has scheduled quarterly reviews in which it may add or remove Constituent Exchanges that satisfy or fail the Inclusion Criteria. The Index Provider does not have any obligation to consider the interests of the Sponsor, the Trust, the shareholders, or anyone else in connection with such changes. The Index Provider is not required to publicize or explain the changes or to alert the Sponsor to such changes. Although the Index methodology is designed to operate without any human interference, rare events would justify manual intervention. Intervention of this kind would be in response to non-market-related events, such as the halting of deposits or withdrawals of funds on a Digital Asset Exchange, the unannounced closure of operations on a Digital Asset Exchange, insolvency or the compromise of user funds. In the event that such an intervention is necessary, the Index Provider would issue a public announcement through its website, API and other established communication channels with its clients.Weighting &#38; Adjustments The Index applies an algorithm to the 24-hour volume-weighted average price of Bitcoin on the Constituent Exchanges calculated on a per second basis. The Index&#8217;s algorithm reflects a four-pronged methodology to calculate the Index Price from the Constituent Exchanges: &#160;&#8226; Volume Weighting: Constituent Exchanges with greater liquidity receive a higher weighting in the Index, increasing the ability to execute against (i.e., replicate) the Index in the underlying spot markets. &#160;&#8226; Price-Variance Weighting: The Index reflects data points that are discretely weighted in proportion to their variance from the rest of the Constituent Exchanges. As the price at a Constituent Exchange diverges from the prices at the rest of the Constituent Exchanges, its weight in the Index consequently decreases. &#160;&#160;&#8226; Inactivity Adjustment. The Index algorithm penalizes stale activity from any given Constituent Exchange. When a Constituent Exchange does not have recent trading data, its weighting in the Index is gradually reduced until it is de-weighted entirely. Similarly, once trading activity at a Constituent Exchange resumes, the corresponding weighting for that Constituent Exchange is gradually increased until it reaches the appropriate level . &#160;&#8226; Manipulation Resistance. In order to mitigate the effects of wash trading and order book spoofing, the Index only includes executed trades in its calculation. Additionally, the Index only includes Constituent Exchanges that charge trading fees to its users in order to attach a real, quantifiable cost to any manipulation attempts. The Index Provider formally re-evaluates the weighting algorithm quarterly, but maintains discretion to change the way in which the Index is calculated based on its periodic review or in extreme circumstances. The Index is designed to limit exposure to trading or price distortion of any individual Digital Asset Exchange that experiences periods of unusual activity or limited liquidity by discounting, in real-time, anomalous price movements at individual Digital Asset Exchanges.The Sponsor believes the Index Provider&#8217;s selection process for Constituent Exchanges as well as the methodology of the Index&#8217;s algorithm provides a more accurate picture of Bitcoin price movements than a simple average of Digital Asset Exchange spot prices, and that the weighting of Bitcoin prices on the Constituent Exchanges limits the inclusion of data that is influenced by temporary price dislocations that may result from technical problems, limited liquidity or fraudulent activity elsewhere in the Bitcoin spot market. By referencing multiple trading venues and weighting them based on trade activity, the Sponsor believes that the impact of any potential fraud, manipulation or anomalous trading activity occurring on any single venue is reduced. The Trust values its Bitcoin for operational purposes by reference to the Index Price. The Index Price is the value of a Bitcoin as represented by the Index, calculated at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on each business day. The Index Provider develops, calculates and publishes the Index on a continuous basis using the volume-weighted price at the Digital Asset Benchmark Exchanges, as selected by the Index Provider. Determining the Digital Asset Reference RateThe Sponsor will use the following cascading set of rules to calculate the Index Price. For the avoidance of doubt, the Sponsor will employ the below rules sequentially and in the order as presented below, should one or more specific rule(s) fail: &#160;1. Index Price &#61; The price set by the Index as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. If the Index becomes unavailable, or if the Sponsor determines in good faith that the Index does not reflect an accurate Bitcoin price, then the Sponsor will, on a best efforts basis, contact the Index Provider to obtain the Index Price directly from the Index Provider. If after such contact the Index remains unavailable or the Sponsor continues to believe in good faith that the Index does not reflect an accurate Bitcoin price, then the Sponsor will employ the next rule to determine the Index Price. &#160;2. Index Price &#61; The volume-weighted average Bitcoin price for the immediately preceding 24-hour period at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the trade date as published by a third party&#8217;s public data feed that is reasonably reliable, subject to the requirement that such data is calculated based upon a volume-weighted price obtained from the major Digital Asset Exchanges (the &#8220;Source&#8221;). Subject to the next sentence, if the Source becomes unavailable (e.g., data sources from the Source for Bitcoin prices become unavailable, unwieldy or otherwise impractical for use) or if the Sponsor determines in good faith that the Source does not reflect an accurate Bitcoin price, then the Sponsor will, on a best efforts basis, contact the Source in an attempt to obtain the relevant data. If after such contact the Source remains unavailable after such contact or the Sponsor continues to believe in good faith that the Source does not reflect an accurate Bitcoin price, then the Sponsor will employ the next rule to determine the Index Price. &#160;3. Index Price &#61; The volume-weighted average price as calculated by dividing the sum of the total volume of Bitcoin transactions in U.S. dollar by the total volume of transactions in Bitcoin, in each case for the immediately preceding 24-hour period as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the trade date as published by a third party&#8217;s public data feed that is reasonably reliable, subject to the requirement that such data is calculated based upon a volume-weighted price obtained from the major Digital Asset Exchanges (the &#8220;Second Source&#8221;). Subject to the next sentence, if the Second Source becomes unavailable (e.g., data sources from the Second Source become unavailable, unwieldy or otherwise impractical for use) or if the Sponsor determines in good faith that the Second Source does not reflect an accurate Bitcoin price, then the Sponsor will, on a best efforts basis, contact the Second Source in an attempt to obtain the relevant data. If after such contact the Second Source remains unavailable after such contact or the Sponsor continues to believe in good faith that the Second Source does not reflect an accurate Bitcoin price, then the Sponsor will employ the next rule to determine the Index Price . &#160;&#160;4. Index Price &#61; The volume-weighted average price as calculated by dividing the sum of the total volume of Bitcoin transactions in U.S. dollar by the total volume of transactions in Bitcoin, in each case for the immediately preceding 24-hour period as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the trade date on the Digital Asset Benchmark Exchanges that represent at least 25% of the aggregate trading volume of the Digital Asset Exchange Market during the last 30 consecutive calendar days and that to the knowledge of the Sponsor are in substantial compliance with the laws, rules and regulations, including any anti-money laundering and know-your-customer procedures (collectively, &#8220; Digital Asset Benchmark Exchanges&#8221;). If there are fewer than three individual Digital Asset Benchmark Exchanges each of which represent at least 25% of the aggregate trading volume on the Digital Asset Exchange Market during the last 30 consecutive calendar days, then the Digital Asset Benchmark Exchanges that will serve as the basis for the Index Price calculation will be those Digital Asset Benchmark Exchanges that meet the above-described requirements, as well as one or more additional Digital Asset Exchanges, as selected by the Sponsor, that has had a monthly trading volume of at least 50,000 Bitcoin during the last 30 consecutive calendar days. The Sponsor will review the composition of the exchanges that comprise the Digital Asset Benchmark Exchanges at the beginning of each month in order to ensure the accuracy of such composition. Subject to the next sentence, if one or more of the Digital Asset Benchmark Exchanges become unavailable (e.g., data sources from the Digital Asset Benchmark Exchanges of Bitcoin prices becomes unavailable, unwieldy or otherwise impractical for use) or if the Sponsor determines in good faith that one or more Digital Asset Benchmark Exchanges do not reflect an accurate Bitcoin price, then the Sponsor will, on a best efforts basis, contact the Digital Asset Benchmark Exchange that is experiencing the service outages in an attempt to obtain the relevant data. If after such contact one or more of the Digital Asset Benchmark Exchanges remain unavailable after such contact or the Sponsor continues to believe in good faith that one or more Digital Asset Benchmark Exchanges do not reflect an accurate Bitcoin price, then the Sponsor will employ the next rule to determine the Index Price. &#160;5. Index Price &#61; The Sponsor will use its best judgment to determine a good faith estimate of the Index Price. In the event of a fork, the Index Provider may calculate the Index Price based on a virtual currency that the Sponsor does not believe to be the appropriate asset that is held by the Trust. In this event, the Sponsor has full discretion to use a different index provider or calculate the Index Price itself using its best judgment. Forms of Attack Against the Bitcoin Network All networked systems are vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. As with any computer network, the Bitcoin Network contains certain flaws. For example, the Bitcoin Network is currently vulnerable to a &#8220;51% attack&#8221; where, if a mining pool were to gain control of more than 50% of the hash rate for a digital asset, a malicious actor would be able to gain full control of the network and the ability to manipulate the Blockchain. In addition, many digital asset networks have been subjected to a number of denial of service attacks, which has led to temporary delays in block creation and in the transfer of Bitcoin. Any similar attacks on the Bitcoin Network that impact the ability to transfer Bitcoin could have a material adverse effect on the price of Bitcoin and the value of the Shares. Market Participants Miners Miners range from Bitcoin enthusiasts to professional mining operations that design and build dedicated machines and data centers, including mining pools, which are groups of miners that act cohesively and combine their processing power to solve blocks. When a pool mines a new block, the pool operator receives the Bitcoin and, after taking a nominal fee, splits the resulting reward among the pool participants based on the processing power each of them contributed to mine such block. Mining pools provide participants with access to smaller, but steadier and more frequent, Bitcoin payouts. See &#8220;&#8212;Creation of New Bitcoin&#8221; above. Investment and Speculative Sector This sector includes the investment and trading activities of both private and professional investors and speculators. Historically, larger financial services institutions are publicly reported to have limited involvement in investment and trading in digital assets, although the participation landscape is beginning to change. Currently, there is relatively limited use of digital assets in the retail and commercial marketplace in comparison to relatively extensive use by speculators, and a significant portion of demand for digital assets is generated by speculators and investors seeking to profit from the short- or long-term holding of digital assets . &#160;Retail Sector The retail sector includes users transacting in direct peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions through the direct sending of Bitcoin over the Bitcoin Network. The retail sector also includes transactions in which consumers pay for goods or services from commercial or service businesses through direct transactions or third-party service providers. Service Sector This sector includes companies that provide a variety of services including the buying, selling, payment processing and storing of Bitcoin. Bitstamp, Coinbase Pro, Kraken and LMAX Digital are some of the largest Digital Asset Exchanges by volume traded. Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC, the Custodian for the Trust, is a digital asset custodian that provides custodial accounts that store Bitcoin for users. As the Bitcoin Network continues to grow in acceptance, it is anticipated that service providers will expand the currently available range of services and that additional parties will enter the service sector for the Bitcoin Network. Competition More than 8,000 other digital assets , as tracked by CoinMarketCap.com, have been developed since the inception of Bitcoin, currently the most developed digital asset because of the length of time it has been in existence, the investment in the infrastructure that supports it, and the network of individuals and entities that are using Bitcoin in transactions. Some industry groups are also creating private, permissioned blockchain versions of digital assets. For example, J.P. Morgan and others are developing an open source platform called Quorum, which is described as a version of Ethereum designed for use by the financial services industry. Government Oversight As digital assets have grown in both popularity and market size, the U.S. Congress and a number of U.S. federal and state agencies (including FinCEN, SEC, CFTC, FINRA, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;), the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the IRS and state financial institution regulators) have been examining the operations of digital asset networks, digital asset users and the Digital Asset Exchange Markets, with particular focus on the extent to which digital assets can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist enterprises and the safety and soundness of exchanges or other service-providers that hold digital assets for users. Many of these state and federal agencies have issued consumer advisories regarding the risks posed by digital assets to investors. In addition, federal and state agencies, and other countries have issued rules or guidance about the treatment of digital asset transactions or requirements for businesses engaged in digital asset activity. In addition, the SEC, U.S. state securities regulators and several foreign governments have issued warnings that digital assets sold in initial coin offerings may be classified as securities and that both those digital assets and initial coin offerings may be subject to securities regulations. Ongoing and future regulatory actions may alter, perhaps to a materially adverse extent, the nature of an investment in the Shares or the ability of the Trust to continue to operate. Additionally, U.S. state and federal, and foreign regulators and legislatures have taken action against virtual currency businesses or enacted restrictive regimes in response to adverse publicity arising from hacks, consumer harm, or criminal activity stemming from virtual currency activity. In July 2019, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that he had &#8220;very serious concerns&#8221; about digital assets. Secretary Mnuchin indicated that one source of concern is digital assets&#8217; potential to be used to fund illicit activities. Secretary Mnuchin has indicated that the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is planning to release new requirements relating to digital asset activities in the first half of 2020. As of the date of this Annual Report, no such requirements have been released. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risk Factors Related to the Regulation of the Trust and the Shares&#8212;Regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of the value of the Shares or restrict the use of Bitcoins, mining activity or the operation of the Bitcoin Network or the Digital Asset Markets in a manner that adversely affects the value of the Shares.&#8221; Law enforcement agencies have often relied on the transparency of blockchains to facilitate investigations. Europol, the European Union&#8217;s law enforcement agency, released a report in October 2017 noting the increased use of privacy-preserving digital assets like Zcash and Monero in criminal activity on the internet and in May 2018 it was reported that Japan&#8217;s Financial Service Agency has been pressuring Japanese digital asset exchanges to delist privacy-preserving digital assets. Although no regulatory action has been taken to treat Zcash, Monero, or other privacy-preserving digital assets differently, this may change in the future. &#160;Various foreign jurisdictions have, and may continue to, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the Bitcoin Network, the Digital Asset Markets, and their users, particularly Digital Asset Exchanges and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions&#8217; regulatory scope. For example, on March 5, 2020, South Korea voted to amend its Financial Information Act to require virtual asset service providers to register and comply with its AML and counter-terrorism funding framework. These measures also provide the government with the authority to close Digital Asset Exchanges that do not comply with specified processes. The Chinese and South Korean governments have also banned initial coin offerings and there are reports that Chinese regulators have taken action to shut down a number of China-based Digital Asset Exchanges . Further, on January 19, 2018, a Chinese news organization reported that the People&#8217;s Bank of China had ordered financial institutions to stop providing banking or funding to &#8220;any activity related to cryptocurrencies.&#8221; Similarly, in April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India banned the entities it regulates from providing services to any individuals or business entities dealing with or settling digital assets. On March 5, 2020, this ban was overturned in the Indian Supreme Court, although the Reserve Bank of India is currently challenging this ruling. There remains significant uncertainty regarding the South Korean, Indian and Chinese governments&#8217; future actions with respect to the regulation of digital assets and Digital Asset Exchanges . Such laws, regulations or directives may conflict with those of the United States and may negatively impact the acceptance of Bitcoin by users, merchants and service providers outside the United States and may therefore impede the growth or sustainability of the Bitcoin economy in the European Union, China, Japan, Russia and the United States and globally, or otherwise negatively affect the value of Bitcoin. In July 2019, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority proposed rules to address harm to retail consumers deriving from the sale of derivatives and exchange traded notes (&#8220;ETNs&#8221;) that reference certain types of digital assets, contending that they are &#8220;ill-suited&#8221; to retail investors citing extreme volatility, valuation challenges and association with financial crime. In addition to ETNs, the proposed ban would affect financial products including contracts for difference, options and futures. Public consultation on the proposed restriction closed in October 2019. As of the date of this Annual Report, the FCA has not yet finalized its proposed ruling. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risk Factors Related to the Regulation of the Trust and the Shares&#8212;Regulatory changes or actions may affect the value of the Shares or restrict the use of Bitcoins, mining activity or the operation of the Bitcoin Network or the Digital Asset Markets in a manner that adversely affects the value of the Shares.&#8221; The effect of any future regulatory change on the Trust or Bitcoin is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and adverse to the Trust and the value of the Shares. Description of the Trust The Trust is a Delaware Statutory Trust that was formed on September 13, 2013 by the filing of the Certificate of Trust with the Delaware Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act (&#8220;DSTA&#8221;). On January 11, 2019, the Trust changed its name from Bitcoin Investment Trust to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) by filing a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Trust with the Delaware Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of the DSTA. The Trust operates pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust. The Trust is passive and is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. The Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins are held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust. The Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins will be transferred out of the Digital Asset Account only in the following circumstances: (i) transferred to pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee or any Additional Trust Expenses, (ii) sold on an as-needed basis to pay Additional Trust Expenses or (iii) sold on behalf of the Trust in the event the Trust terminates and liquidates its assets or as otherwise required by law or regulation. Assuming that the Trust is treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each delivery or sale of Bitcoins by the Trust to pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee or any Additional Trust Expenses will be a taxable event for shareholders . See &#8220;&#8212;Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences&#8212;Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders.&#8221; The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act and the Sponsor believes that the Trust is not required to register under the Investment Company Act. The Trust will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts or other derivative contracts regulated by the CEA, as administered by the CFTC. The Sponsor believes that the Trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the CEA, and that neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee is subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading adviser in connection with the operation of the Trust . The Trust creates Shares from time to time but only in Baskets. A Basket equals a block of 100 Shares. The number of outstanding Shares is expected to increase from time to time as a result of the creation of Baskets. The creation of Baskets will require the delivery to the Trust of the number of Bitcoins represented by the Baskets being created. The creation of a Basket will be made only in exchange for the delivery to the Trust of the number of whole and fractional Bitcoins represented by each Basket being created, the number of which is determined by dividing (x) the number of Bitcoins owned by the Trust at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the relevant trade date, after deducting the number of Bitcoins representing the U.S. dollar value of accrued but unpaid fees and expenses of the Trust (converted using the Index Price at such time, and carried to the eighth decimal place) by (y) the number of Shares outstanding at such time (with the quotient so obtained calculated to one one-hundred-millionth of one Bitcoin ( i.e. , carried to the eighth decimal place)), and multiplying such quotient by 100. &#160;Although the redemption of Shares is provided for in the Trust Agreement, the redemption of Shares is not currently permitted and the Trust does not currently operate a redemption program. Subject to receipt of regulatory approval from the SEC and approval by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, the Trust may in the future operate a redemption program. Because the Trust does not believe that the SEC would, at this time, entertain an application for the waiver of rules needed in order to operate an ongoing redemption program, the Trust currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval from the SEC to operate an ongoing redemption program. Even if such relief is sought in the future, no assurance can be given as to the timing of such relief or that such relief will be granted. If such relief is granted and the Sponsor approves a redemption program, the Shares will be redeemable in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and the relevant Participant Agreement. Although the Sponsor cannot predict with certainty what effect, if any, the operation of a redemption program would have on the trading price of the Shares, a redemption program would allow Authorized Participants to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities created when the market value of the Shares deviates from the value of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities, which may have the effect of reducing any premium at which the Shares trade on OTCQX over such value or cause the Shares to trade at a discount to such value from time to time . Each Share represented approximately 0.0010 of one Bitcoin as of December 31, 2020. Each Share in the initial Baskets represented approximately one-tenth (0.1) of a Bitcoin. The decrease in the number of Bitcoin represented by each Share since inception is primarily a result of the Share Split and, to a lesser degree, the periodic withdrawal of Bitcoin to pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee and any Additional Trust Expenses. The number of Bitcoins required to create a Basket is expected to continue to gradually decrease over time due to the transfer or sale of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins to pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee and any Additional Trust Expenses. The Trust will not accept or distribute cash in exchange for Baskets other than upon its dissolution. Authorized Participants may sell to other investors the Shares they purchase from the Trust only in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act. For a discussion of risks relating to the unavailability of a redemption program, see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risk Factors Related to the Trust and the Shares&#8212; Because of the holding period under Rule 144, the lack of an ongoing redemption program and the Trust&#8217;s ability to halt creations from time to time, there is no arbitrage mechanism to keep the price of the Shares closely linked to the Index Price and the Shares have historically traded at a substantial premium over the Digital Asset Holdings per Share .&#8221; The Sponsor will determine the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings on each business day as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, or as soon thereafter as practicable. The Sponsor will also determine the Digital Asset Holdings per Share, which equals the Digital Asset Holdings divided by the number of outstanding Shares. Each business day, the Sponsor will publish the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings and Digital Asset Holdings per Share on the Trust&#8217;s website, https:\/\/grayscale.co\/bitcoin-trust\/#market-performance, as soon as practicable after the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings and Digital Asset Holdings per Share have been determined by the Sponsor. See &#8220;&#8212;Valuation of Bitcoin and Determination of the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings.&#8221; The Trust&#8217;s assets consist solely of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights, IR Virtual Currency, proceeds from the sale of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency pending use of such cash for payment of Additional Trust Expenses or distribution to the shareholders and any rights of the Trust pursuant to any agreements, other than the Trust Agreement, to which the Trust is a party. Each Share represents a proportional interest, based on the total number of Shares outstanding, in each of the Trust&#8217;s assets as determined in the case of Bitcoin by reference to the Index Price, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities (which include accrued but unpaid fees and expenses). The Sponsor expects that the market price of the Shares will fluctuate over time in response to the market prices of Bitcoins. In addition, because the Shares reflect the estimated accrued but unpaid expenses of the Trust, the number of Bitcoins represented by a Share will gradually decrease over time as the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins are used to pay the Trust&#8217;s expenses. The Trust does not expect to take any Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency it may hold into account for purposes of determining the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings or the Digital Asset Holdings per Share. Bitcoin pricing information is available on a 24-hour basis from various financial information service providers or Bitcoin Network information sites such as Tradeblock.com or Bitcoincharts.com. The spot price and bid\/ask spreads may also be available directly from Digital Asset Exchanges. As of December 31, 2020, the constituent Digital Asset Exchanges of the Index were Coinbase Pro, Bitstamp, Kraken and LMAX Digital. Effective February 17, 2017, OKCoin was removed from the Index due to a suspension in withdrawals. Bitfinex was also previously included in the Index and was removed on May 3, 2017 due to difficulties withdrawing fiat currencies from its Taiwanese banks, and as a result, it stopped accepting incoming wires, leading to volatility in the price of Bitcoin on Bitfinex. In response to removing Bitfinex, the Index Provider added Kraken to the Index on May 3, 2017. On October 20, 2017, the Index Provider removed Kraken from the Index due to inconsistencies in the trade data timestamps. On January 15, 2019, the Index Provider added back Kraken and also added Bittrex to the Index. On January 19, 2020, as part of a scheduled quarterly review, the Index Provider delisted the Bittrex constituent and added the LMAX Digital constituent. On April 6, 2020, the Index Provider removed itBit and did not add any constituents as part of its scheduled quarterly review. The Index Provider may remove or add Digital Asset Exchanges to the Index in the future at its discretion. Market prices for the Shares will be available from a variety of sources, including brokerage firms, information websites and other information service providers. In addition, on each business day the Trust&#8217;s website will provide pricing information for the Shares. The Trust has no fixed termination date. &#160;Service Providers of the Trust The Sponsor The Trust&#8217;s Sponsor is Grayscale Investments, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formed on May 29, 2013 and a wholly owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, Inc.

Under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and the governing documents of the Sponsor, Digital Currency Group, Inc., the sole member of the Sponsor, is not responsible for the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Sponsor solely by reason of being the sole member of the Sponsor. The Sponsor is neither an investment adviser registered with the SEC nor a commodity pool operator registered with the CFTC, and will not be acting in either such capacity with respect to the Trust, and the Sponsor&#8217;s provision of services to the Trust will not be governed by the Investment Advisers Act or the CEA. The Sponsor arranged for the creation of the Trust and quotation of the Shares on OTCQX. As partial consideration for its receipt of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee from the Trust, the Sponsor is obligated to pay the Sponsor-paid Expenses. The Sponsor also paid the costs of the Trust&#8217;s organization and the costs of the initial sale of the Shares. The Sponsor is generally responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust under the provisions of the Trust Agreement. This includes (i) preparing and providing periodic reports and financial statements on behalf of the Trust for investors, (ii) processing orders to create Baskets and coordinating the processing of such orders with the Custodian and the Transfer Agent, (iii) calculating and publishing the Digital Asset Holdings and the Digital Asset Holdings per Share of the Trust each business day as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, or as soon thereafter as practicable, (iv) selecting and monitoring the Trust&#8217;s service providers and from time to time engaging additional, successor or replacement service providers, (v) instructing the Custodian to transfer the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin as needed to pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee and any Additional Trust Expenses, (vi) upon dissolution of the Trust, distributing the Trust&#8217;s remaining Bitcoin, Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency or the cash proceeds of the sale thereof to the owners of record of the Shares and (vii) establishing the principal market for GAAP valuation.

The Sponsor does not store, hold, or maintain custody or control of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin but instead has entered into the Custodian Agreement with the Custodian to facilitate the security of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin. The Sponsor may transfer all or substantially all of its assets to an entity that carries on the business of the Sponsor if at the time of the transfer the successor assumes all of the obligations of the Sponsor under the Trust Agreement. In such an event, the Sponsor will be relieved of all further liability under the Trust Agreement. The Sponsor&#8217;s Fee is paid by the Trust to the Sponsor as compensation for services performed under the Trust Agreement and as partial consideration for the Sponsor&#8217;s agreement to pay the Sponsor-paid Expenses. See &#8220;&#8212;Expenses&#59; Sales of Bitcoins.&#8221; Distribution and Marketing Agreement The Sponsor has entered into a Distribution and Marketing Agreement with Genesis Global Trading, Inc. (&#8220;Genesis&#8221;), a related party of the Trust, to assist the Sponsor in distributing the Shares, developing an ongoing marketing plan for the Trust, preparing marketing materials regarding the Shares, including the content on the Trust&#8217;s website, www.grayscale.co\/bitcoin-trust, executing the marketing plan for the Trust and providing strategic and tactical research on the Digital Asset Markets.

Fees paid to the Transfer Agent are a Sponsor-paid Expense. Authorized Participants An Authorized Participant must enter into a &#8220;Participant Agreement&#8221; with the Sponsor and the Trust to govern its placement of orders to create Baskets.

No Authorized Participant has any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor or the Trust to effect any sale or resale of Shares. The Custodian Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC is a fiduciary under &#167; 100 of the New York Banking Law and a qualified custodian for purposes of Rule 206(4)-2(d)(6) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. The Custodian is authorized to serve as the Trust&#8217;s custodian under the Trust Agreement and pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Custodian Agreement. The Custodian has &#160;its principal office at 200 Park Avenue South, Suite 1208, New York, NY 10003. A copy of the Custodian Agreement is available for inspection at the Sponsor&#8217;s principal office identified herein. Under the Custodian Agreement, the Custodian controls and secures the Trust&#8217;s &#8220;Digital Asset Account,&#8221; a segregated custody account to store private keys, which allow for the transfer of ownership or control of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins, on the Trust&#8217;s behalf. The Custodian&#8217;s services (i) allow Bitcoins to be deposited from a public blockchain address to the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Account and (ii) allow the Trust or Sponsor to withdraw Bitcoins from the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Account to a public blockchain address the Trust or Sponsor controls (the &#8220;Custodial Services&#8221;). The Digital Asset Account uses offline storage, or &#8220;cold&#8221; storage, mechanisms to secure the Trust&#8217;s private keys. The term cold storage refers to a safeguarding method by which the private keys corresponding to digital assets are disconnected and\/or deleted entirely from the internet. The Custodian will withdraw from the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Account the number of Bitcoins necessary to pay the Trust&#8217;s expenses. Fees paid to the Custodian are a Sponsor-paid Expense. Under the Custodian Agreement, each of the Custodian and the Trust has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the other party from any third-party claim or third-party demand (including reasonable and documented attorneys&#8217; fees and any fines, fees or penalties imposed by any regulatory authority) arising out of or related to the Custodian&#8217;s or the Trust&#8217;s, as the case may be, breach of the Custodian Agreement, inaccuracy in any of the Custodian&#8217;s or the Trust&#8217;s, as the case may be, representations or warranties in the Custodian Agreement, or the Trust&#8217;s violation, or the Custodian&#8217;s knowing violation, of any law, rule or regulation, or the rights of any third party, except where such claim directly results from the gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of the other such party. The Custodian and its affiliates may from time to time purchase or sell Bitcoins for their own accounts and as agent for their customers or Shares for their own accounts. The foregoing notwithstanding, Bitcoin in the Digital Asset Account are not treated as general assets of the Custodian and cannot be commingled with any other digital assets held by the Custodian. The Custodian serves as a fiduciary and custodian on the Trust&#8217;s behalf, and the Bitcoin in the Digital Asset Account are considered fiduciary assets that remain the Trust&#8217;s property at all times. Once each calendar year, the Sponsor or the Trust may request that the Custodian deliver a certificate signed by a duly authorized officer to certify that the Custodian has complied and is currently in compliance with the Custodian Agreement and that all representations and warranties made by the Custodian in the Custodian Agreement are true and correct on and as of the date of such certificate, and have been true and correct throughout the preceding year. In addition, the Custodian has agreed to allow the Trust and the Sponsor to take any necessary steps to verify that satisfactory internal control system and procedures are in place, and to visit and inspect the systems on which the Custodian&#8217;s coins are held. If the Custodian resigns in its capacity as custodian, the Sponsor may appoint an additional or replacement custodian and enter into a custodian agreement on behalf of the Trust with such custodian. Furthermore, the Sponsor and the Trust may use Bitcoin custody services or similar services provided by entities other than Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC at any time without prior notice to Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC. Custody of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins Digital assets and digital asset transactions are recorded and validated on blockchains, the public transaction ledgers of a digital asset network. Each digital asset blockchain serves as a record of ownership for all of the units of such digital asset, even in the case of certain privacy-preserving digital assets, where the transactions themselves are not publicly viewable. All digital assets recorded on a blockchain are associated with a public blockchain address, also referred to as a digital wallet. Digital assets held at a particular public blockchain address may be accessed and transferred using a corresponding private key. Key Generation Public addresses and their corresponding private keys are generated by the Custodian in secret key generation ceremonies at secure locations inside faraday cages, which are enclosures used to block electromagnetic fields and thus mitigate against attacks. The Custodian uses quantum random number generators to generate the public and private key pairs. Once generated, private keys are encrypted, separated into &#8220;shards&#8221; and then further encrypted. After the key generation ceremony, all materials used to generate private keys, including computers, are destroyed. All key generation ceremonies are performed offline. No party other than the Custodian has access to the private key shards of the Trust. &#160;Key Storage Private key shards are distributed geographically in secure vaults around the world, including in the United States. The locations of the secure vaults may change regularly and are kept confidential by the Custodian for security purposes. The Digital Asset Account uses offline storage, or &#8220;cold&#8221; storage, mechanisms to secure the Trust&#8217;s private keys. The term cold storage refers to a safeguarding method by which the private keys corresponding to digital assets are disconnected and\/or deleted entirely from the internet. Cold storage of private keys may involve keeping such keys on a non-networked (or &#8220;air-gapped&#8221;) computer or electronic device or storing the private keys on a storage device (for example, a USB thumb drive) or printed medium (for example, papyrus, paper or a metallic object). A digital wallet may receive deposits of digital assets but may not send digital assets without use of the digital assets&#8217; corresponding private keys. In order to send digital assets from a digital wallet in which the private keys are kept in cold storage, either the private keys must be retrieved from cold storage and entered into an online, or &#8220;hot&#8221;, digital asset software program to sign the transaction, or the unsigned transaction must be transferred to the cold server in which the private keys are held for signature by the private keys and then transferred back to the online digital asset software program. At that point, the user of the digital wallet can transfer its digital assets. Security Procedures The Custodian is the custodian of the Trust&#8217;s private keys in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Custodian Agreement. Transfers from the Digital Asset Account requires certain security procedures, including but not limited to, multiple encrypted private key shards, usernames, passwords and 2-step verification. Multiple private key shards held by the Custodian must be combined to reconstitute the private key to sign any transaction in order to transfer the Trust&#8217;s assets. Private key shards are distributed geographically in secure vaults around the world, including in the United States. As a result, if any one secure vault is ever compromised, this event will have no impact on the ability of the Trust to access its assets, other than a possible delay in operations, while one or more of the other secure vaults is used instead. These security procedures are intended to remove single points of failure in the protection of the Trust&#8217;s assets. Transfers of Bitcoins to the Digital Asset Account will be available to the Trust once processed on the Blockchain. Subject to obtaining regulatory approval to operate a redemption program and authorization of the Sponsor, the process of accessing and withdrawing Bitcoins from the Trust to redeem a Basket by an Authorized Participant will follow the same general procedure as transferring Bitcoins to the Trust to create a Basket by an Authorized Participant, only in reverse. See &#8220;&#8212;Description of Creation of Shares.&#8221; The Distributor and Marketer Genesis Global Trading, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is the distributor and marketer of the Shares. Genesis is a registered broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of FINRA. In its capacity as distributor and marketer, Genesis assists the Sponsor in developing an ongoing marketing plan for the Trust&#59; preparing marketing materials regarding the Shares, including the content on the Trust&#8217;s website, http:\/\/grayscale.co\/bitcoin-trust &#59; executing the marketing plan for the Trust&#59; and providing strategic and tactical research to the Trust on the Digital Asset Markets. Genesis and the Sponsor are affiliates of one another. The Sponsor has entered into a Distribution and Marketing Agreement with Genesis. The Sponsor may engage additional or successor distributors and marketers in the future. Description of the Shares The Trust is authorized under the Trust Agreement to create and issue an unlimited number of Shares. Shares will be issued only in Baskets (a Basket equals a block of 100 Shares) in connection with creations. The Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust and have no par value. On January 26, 2018, the Trust completed a 91-for-1 Share split of the Trust&#8217;s issued and outstanding Shares. In connection with the Share Split, shareholders of record on January 22, 2018 received ninety additional Shares of the Trust for each Share held. The number of outstanding Shares and per-Share amounts disclosed for periods prior to January 26, 2018 have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Share Split, as applicable. Description of Limited Rights The Shares do not represent a traditional investment and should not be viewed as similar to &#8220;shares&#8221; of a corporation operating a business enterprise with management and a board of directors. A shareholder will not have the statutory rights normally associated &#160;with the ownership of shares of a corporation. Each Share is transferable, is fully paid and non-assessable and entitles the holder to vote on the limited matters upon which s hareholders may vote under the Trust Agreement. For example, s hareholders do not have the right to elect directors and will not receive dividends. The Shares do not entitle their holders to any conversion or pre-emptive rights or, except as discussed below, any redemption rights or rights to distributions. Voting and Approvals The shareholders take no part in the management or control of the Trust. Under the Trust Agreement, shareholders have limited voting rights. For example, in the event that the Sponsor withdraws, a majority of the shareholders may elect and appoint a successor sponsor to carry out the affairs of the Trust. In addition, no amendments to the Trust Agreement that materially adversely affect the interests of shareholders may be made without the vote of at least a majority (over 50%) of the Shares (not including any Shares held by the Sponsor or its affiliates). However, the Sponsor may make any other amendments to the Trust Agreement in its sole discretion without shareholder consent provided that the Sponsor provides 20 days&#8217; notice of any such amendment. Distributions Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust may make distributions on the Shares in-cash or in-kind, including in such form as is necessary or permissible for the Trust to facilitate shareholders&#8217; access to any Incidental Rights or to IR Virtual Currency. In addition, if the Trust is terminated and liquidated, the Sponsor will distribute to the shareholders any amounts of the cash proceeds of the liquidation remaining after the satisfaction of all outstanding liabilities of the Trust and the establishment of reserves for applicable taxes, other governmental charges and contingent or future liabilities as the Sponsor will determine. See &#8220;&#8212;Description of the Trust Agreement&#8212;The Trustee&#8212;Termination of the Trust.&#8221; Shareholders of record on the record date fixed by the Transfer Agent for a distribution will be entitled to receive their pro rata portions of any distribution. Appointment of Agent Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, by holding the Shares, shareholders will be deemed to agree that the Sponsor may cause the Trust to appoint an agent (any person appointed in such capacity, an &#8220;Agent&#8221;) to act on their behalf in connection with any distribution of Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency if the Sponsor has determined in good faith that such appointment is reasonably necessary or in the best interests of the Trust and the shareholders in order to facilitate the distribution of any Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency. The Sponsor may cause the Trust to appoint Grayscale Investments, LLC (acting other than in its capacity as Sponsor) or any of its affiliates to act in such capacity. Any Agent appointed to facilitate a distribution of Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency will receive an in-kind distribution of Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency on behalf of the shareholders of record with respect to such distribution, and following receipt of such distribution, will determine, in its sole discretion and without any direction from the Trust, or the Sponsor, in its capacity as Sponsor of the Trust, whether and when to sell the distributed Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency on behalf of the record date shareholders. If the Agent is able to do so, it will remit the cash proceeds to the record date shareholders. There can be no assurance as to the price or prices for any Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency that the Agent may realize, and the value of the Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency may increase or decrease after any sale by the Agent. Any Agent appointed pursuant to the Trust Agreement will not receive any compensation in connection with its role as agent. However, any Agent will be entitled to receive from the record-date shareholders, out of the distributed Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency, an amount of Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency with an aggregate fair market value equal to the amount of administrative and other reasonable expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with its activities as agent of the record-date shareholders, including expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with any post-distribution sale of such Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency. The Sponsor currently expects to cause the Trust to appoint Grayscale Investments, LLC, acting other than in its capacity as Sponsor, as Agent to facilitate any distribution of Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency to shareholders. The Trust has no right to receive any information about any distributed Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency or the disposition thereof from the record date shareholders, their Agent or any other person. Creation of Shares The Trust creates Shares at such times and for such periods as determined by the Sponsor, but only in one or more whole Baskets. A Basket equals 100 Shares. As of December 31, 2020, each Share represented approximately 0.0010 of one Bitcoin. See &#8220;&#8212;Description of Creation of Shares.&#8221; The creation of a Basket requires the delivery to the Trust of the number of Bitcoins represented &#160;by one Share immediately prior to such creation multiplied by 100. The Trust may from time to time halt creations for a variety of reasons, including in connection forks, airdrops and other similar occurrences . Redemption of Shares Effective October 28, 2014, the Trust suspended its redemption program, in which shareholders were permitted to request the redemption of their Shares through Genesis, the sole Authorized Participant at that time, out of concern that the redemption program was in violation of Regulation M under the Exchange Act. On July 11, 2016, Genesis and the Trust entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC whereby they agreed to a cease-and-desist order against future violations of Rules 101 and 102 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Genesis also agreed to pay disgorgement of $51,650.11 in redemption fees it collected, plus prejudgment interest of $2,105.68, for a total of $53,755.79. Redemptions of Shares are currently not permitted and the Trust is unable to redeem Shares. Subject to receipt of regulatory approval from the SEC and approval by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, the Trust may in the future operate a redemption program. Because the Trust does not believe that the SEC would, at this time, entertain an application for the waiver of rules needed in order to operate an ongoing redemption program, the Trust currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval from the SEC to operate an ongoing redemption program. Even if such relief is sought in the future, no assurance can be given as to the timing of such relief or that such relief will be granted. If such relief is granted and the Sponsor approves a redemption program, the Shares will be redeemable only in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and the relevant Participant Agreement. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; Risk Factors Related to the Trust and the Shares&#8212;Because of the holding period under Rule 144, the lack of an ongoing redemption program and the Trust&#8217;s ability to halt creations from time to time, there is no arbitrage mechanism to keep the price of the Shares closely linked to the Index Price and the Shares have historically traded at a substantial premium over the Digital Asset Holdings per Share.&#8221; Transfer Restrictions Shares purchased in the private placement are restricted securities that may not be resold except in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act and state securities laws and any such transaction must be approved by the Sponsor. In determining whether to grant approval, the Sponsor will specifically look at whether the conditions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and any other applicable laws have been met. Any attempt to sell Shares without the approval of the Sponsor in its sole discretion will be void ab initio . Pursuant to Rule 144, a minimum six-month holding period applies to all Shares purchased from the Trust. On a bi-weekly basis, the Trust aggregates the Shares that have been held for the requisite holding period under Rule 144 by non-affiliates of the Trust to assess whether the Rule 144 transfer restriction legends may be removed. Any Shares that qualify for the removal of the Rule 144 transfer restriction legends are presented to outside counsel, who may instruct the Transfer Agent to remove the transfer restriction legends from the Shares, allowing the Shares to then be resold without restriction, including on OTCQX U.S. Premier marketplace. The outside counsel requires that certain representations be made, providing that: &#160;&#8226; the Shares subject to each sale have been held for the requisite holding period under Rule 144 by the selling shareholder&#59; &#160;&#8226; the shareholder is the sole beneficial owner of the Shares&#59; &#160;&#8226; the Sponsor is aware of no circumstances in which the shareholder would be considered an underwriter or engaged in the distribution of securities for the Trust&#59; &#160;&#8226; none of the Shares are subject to any agreement granting any pledge, lien, mortgage, hypothecation, security interest, charge, option or encumbrance&#59; &#160;&#8226; none of the identified selling shareholders is an affiliate of the Sponsor&#59; &#160;&#8226; the Sponsor consents to the transfer of the Shares&#59; and &#160;&#8226; outside counsel and the Transfer Agent can rely on the representations. In addition, because the Trust Agreement prohibits the transfer or sale of Shares without the prior written consent of the Sponsor, the Sponsor must provide a written consent that explicitly states that it irrevocably consents to the transfer and resale of the Shares. Once the transfer restriction legends have been removed from a Share and the Sponsor has provided its written consent to the transfer of that Share, no consent of the Sponsor is required for future transfers of that particular Share. &#160;Book-Entry Form Shares are held primarily in book-entry form by the Transfer Agent. The Sponsor or its delegate will direct the Transfer Agent to credit the number of Creation Baskets to the applicable Authorized Participant. The Transfer Agent will issue Creation Baskets. Transfers will be made in accordance with standard securities industry practice. The Sponsor may cause the Trust to issue Shares in certificated form in limited circumstances in its sole discretion. Share Splits In its discretion, the Sponsor may direct the Transfer Agent to declare a split or reverse split in the number of Shares outstanding and to make a corresponding change in the number of Shares constituting a Basket. For example, if the Sponsor believes that the per Share price in the secondary market for Shares has risen or fallen outside a desirable trading price range, it may declare such a split or reverse split. Description of Creation of Shares The following is a description of the material terms of the Trust Documents as they relate to the creation of the Trust&#8217;s Shares on a periodic basis from time to time through sales in private placement transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Trust Documents also provide procedures for the redemption of Shares. However, the Trust does not currently operate a redemption program and the Shares are not currently redeemable. Subject to receipt of regulatory approval from the SEC and approval by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, the Trust may in the future operate a redemption program. Because the Trust does not believe that the SEC would, at this time, entertain an application for the waiver of rules needed in order to operate an ongoing redemption program, the Trust currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval from the SEC to operate an ongoing redemption program. The Trust will issue Shares to Authorized Participants from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets (with a Basket being a block of 100 Shares). The Trust will not issue fractions of a Basket. The creation of Baskets will be made only in exchange for the delivery to the Trust, or the distribution by the Trust, of the number of whole and fractional Bitcoins represented by each Basket being created, which is determined by dividing (x) the number of Bitcoins owned by the Trust at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the trade date of a creation order, after deducting the number of Bitcoins representing the U.S. dollar value of accrued but unpaid fees and expenses of the Trust (converted using the Index Price at such time, and carried to the eighth decimal place), by (y) the number of Shares outstanding at such time (with the quotient so obtained calculated to one one-hundred-millionth of one Bitcoin ( i.e. , carried to the eighth decimal place)), and multiplying such quotient by 100 (the &#8220;Basket Amount&#8221;). All questions as to the calculation of the Basket Amount will be conclusively determined by the Sponsor and will be final and binding on all persons interested in the Trust. The Basket Amount multiplied by the number of Baskets being created is the &#8220;Total Basket Amount.&#8221; The number of Bitcoins represented by a Share will gradually decrease over time as the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins are used to pay the Trust&#8217;s expenses. As of December 31, 2020, each Share represented approximately 0.0010 of one Bitcoin. Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create Baskets. Each Authorized Participant must (i) be a registered broker-dealer, (ii) enter into a Participant Agreement with the Sponsor and (iii) own a Bitcoin wallet address that is recognized by the Custodian as belonging to the Authorized Participant. An Authorized Participant may act for its own account or as agent for investors who have entered into a subscription agreement with the Authorized Participant (each such investor, an &#8220;Investor&#8221;). An Investor that enters into a subscription agreement with an Authorized Participant subscribes for Shares by submitting a purchase order and paying a subscription amount, either in U.S. dollars or in Bitcoins, to the Authorized Participant. An Investor may pay the subscription amount in cash or Bitcoins. In the event that the Investor pays the subscription amount in cash, the Authorized Participant will use such cash to purchase Bitcoins with such cash, and will contribute those Bitcoins in kind to the Trust, on behalf of the Investor. In exchange, the Authorized Participant will receive Shares of the Trust on behalf of the Investor, and the Shares will then be registered in the name of the Investor. In the event that the Investor pays the subscription amount in Bitcoins, the Investor will transfer such Bitcoins to the Authorized Participant, which will contribute such Bitcoins in kind to the Trust, and receive Shares of the Trust, on behalf of the Investor, and the Shares will then be registered in the name of the Investor. For the avoidance of doubt, in either case, the Authorized Participant will act as the agent of the Investor with respect to the contribution of cash or Bitcoins to the Trust in exchange for Shares. The creation of Baskets requires the delivery to the Trust of the Total Basket Amount. The Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation of Baskets and for the delivery of the whole and fractional Bitcoins required for such creations. The Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by the &#160;Sponsor and the relevant Authorized Participant. Under the Participant Agreement, the Sponsor has agreed to indemnify each Authorized Participant against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Authorized Participants do not pay a transaction fee to the Trust in connection with the creation of Baskets, but there may be transaction fees associated with the validation of the transfer of Bitcoins by the Bitcoin Network. Authorized Participants who deposit Bitcoins with the Trust in exchange for Baskets will receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the Sponsor or the Trust, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor or the Trust to effect any sale or resale of Shares. The following description of the procedures for the creation of Baskets is only a summary and shareholders should refer to the relevant provisions of the Trust Agreement and the form of Participant Agreement for more detail. Creation Procedures On any business day, an Authorized Participant may order one or more Creation Baskets from the Trust by placing a creation order with the Sponsor no later than 4:00 p.m., New York time, which the Sponsor will accept or reject. By placing a creation order, an Authorized Participant agrees to transfer the Total Basket Amount from the Bitcoin wallet address that is known to the Custodian as belonging to the Authorized Participant to the Digital Asset Account. All creation orders are accepted (or rejected) by the Sponsor on the business day on which the relevant creation order is placed. If a creation order is accepted, the Sponsor will calculate the Total Basket Amount on the same business day, which will be the trade date, and will communicate the Total Basket Amount to the Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant must transfer the Total Basket Amount to the Trust no later than 6:00 p.m., New York time, on the trade date. The expense and risk of delivery, ownership and safekeeping of Bitcoins will be borne solely by the Authorized Participant until such Bitcoin have been received by the Trust. Following receipt of the Total Basket Amount by the Custodian, the Transfer Agent will credit the number of Shares to the account of the Investor on behalf of which the Authorized Participant placed the creation order by no later than 6:00 p.m., New York time, on the trade date. The Authorized Participant may then transfer the Shares directly to the relevant Investor. Suspension or Rejection of Orders and Total Basket Amount The creation of Shares may be suspended generally, or refused with respect to particular requested creations, during any period when the transfer books of the Transfer Agent are closed or if circumstances outside the control of the Sponsor or its delegates make it for all practical purposes not feasible to process such creation orders. The Sponsor may reject an order or, after accepting an order, may cancel such order by rejecting the Total Basket Amount if (i) such order is not presented in proper form as described in the Participant Agreement, (ii) the transfer of the Total Basket Amount comes from an account other than a Bitcoin wallet address that is known to the Custodian as belonging to the Authorized Participant or (iii) the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of counsel, might be unlawful, among other reasons. None of the Sponsor or its delegates will be liable for the suspension, rejection or acceptance of any creation order or Total Basket Amount. In particular, upon the Trust&#8217;s receipt of any Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency in connection with a fork, airdrop or similar event, the Sponsor will suspend creations until it is able to cause the Trust to sell or distribute such Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency. None of the Sponsor or its delegates will be liable for the suspension, rejection or acceptance of any creation order or Total Basket Amount. Tax Responsibility Authorized Participants are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value-added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation of Baskets, regardless of whether such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Participant, and agree to indemnify the Sponsor and the Trust if the Sponsor or the Trust is required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax or interest thereon. Valuation of Bitcoin and Determination of Digital Asset Holdings The Sponsor will evaluate the Bitcoins held by the Trust and determine the Digital Asset Holdings of the Trust in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Trust Documents. The following is a description of the material terms of the Trust Documents as they relate to valuation of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins and the Digital Asset Holdings calculations. &#160;On each business day at 4:00 p.m., New York time, or as soon thereafter as practicable (the &#8220;Evaluation Time&#8221;), the Sponsor will evaluate the Bitcoins held by the Trust and calculate and publish the Digital Asset Holdings of the Trust. To calculate the Digital Asset Holdings, the Sponsor will: &#160;1. Determine the Index Price as of such business day. &#160;2. Multiply the Index Price by the Trust&#8217;s aggregate number of Bitcoins owned by the Trust as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the immediately preceding day, less the aggregate number of Bitcoins payable as the accrued and unpaid Sponsor&#8217;s Fee as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the immediately preceding day. &#160;3. Add the U.S. dollar value of Bitcoins, calculated using the Index Price, receivable under pending creation orders, if any, determined by multiplying the number of the Creation Baskets represented by such creation orders by the Basket Amount and then multiplying such product by the Index Price. &#160;4. Subtract the U.S. dollar amount of accrued and unpaid Additional Trust Expenses, if any. &#160;5. Subtract the U.S. dollar value of the Bitcoins, calculated using the Index Price, to be distributed under pending redemption orders, if any, determined by multiplying the number of Baskets to be redeemed represented by such redemption orders by the Basket Amount and then multiplying such product by the Index Price (the amount derived from steps 1 through 5 above, the &#8220;Digital Asset Holdings Fee Basis Amount&#8221;). &#160;6. Subtract the U.S. dollar amount of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee that accrues for such business day, as calculated based on the Digital Asset Holdings Fee Basis Amount for such business day. In the event that the Sponsor determines that the primary methodology used to determine the Index Price is not an appropriate basis for valuation of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins, the Sponsor will utilize the cascading set of rules as described in &#8220;&#8212;Overview of the Bitcoin Industry Market&#8212;Bitcoin Value&#8212;The Index and the Index Price.&#8221; In addition, in the event that the Trust holds any Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency, the Sponsor may, at its discretion, include the value of such Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency in the determination of the Digital Asset Holdings, provided that the Sponsor has determined in good faith a method for assigning an objective value to such Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency. At this time, the Trust does not expect to take any Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency it may hold into account for the purposes of determining the Digital Asset Holdings or the Digital Asset Holdings per Share. The Sponsor will publish the Index Price, the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings and the Digital Asset Holdings per Share on the Trust&#8217;s website as soon as practicable after its determination. If the Digital Asset Holdings and Digital Asset Holdings per Share have been calculated using a price per Bitcoin other than the Index Price for such Evaluation Time, the publication on the Trust&#8217;s website will note the valuation methodology used and the price per Bitcoin resulting from such calculation. In the event of a hard fork of the Bitcoin Network, the Sponsor will, if permitted by the terms of the Trust Agreement, use its discretion to determine, in good faith, which peer-to-peer network, among a group of incompatible forks of the Bitcoin Network, is generally accepted as the network for Bitcoin and should therefore be considered the appropriate network for the Trust&#8217;s purposes. The Sponsor will base its determination on a variety of then relevant factors, including (but not limited to) the following: (i) the Sponsor&#8217;s beliefs regarding expectations of the core developers of Bitcoin, users, services, businesses, miners and other constituencies and (ii) the actual continued acceptance of, mining power on, and community engagement with the Bitcoin Network. The shareholders may rely on any evaluation furnished by the Sponsor. The determinations that the Sponsor makes will be made in good faith upon the basis of, and the Sponsor will not be liable for any errors contained in, information reasonably available to it. The Sponsor will not be liable to the Authorized Participants, the shareholders or any other person for errors in judgment. However, the preceding liability exclusion will not protect the Sponsor against any liability resulting from gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith in the performance of its duties. Expenses&#59; Sales of Bitcoins The Trust&#8217;s only ordinary recurring expense is expected to be the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee. The Sponsor&#8217;s Fee will accrue daily in U.S. dollars at an annual rate of 2.0% of the Digital Asset Holdings Fee Basis Amount of the Trust as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on each day&#59; provided that for a day that is not a business day, the calculation will be based on the Digital Asset Holdings Fee Basis Amount from the most recent business day, reduced by the accrued and unpaid Sponsor&#8217;s Fee for such most recent business day and for each day after such most recent business day and prior to the relevant calculation date. This dollar amount for each daily accrual will then be converted into Bitcoins by reference to the same Index Price used to determine such accrual. The Sponsor&#8217;s Fee is payable in Bitcoins to the Sponsor monthly in arrears. &#160;Expenses to Be Paid by the Sponsor The Trust pays the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee to the Sponsor. As partial consideration for its receipt of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee from the Trust, the Sponsor is obligated under the Trust Agreement to assume and pay all fees and other expenses incurred by the Trust in the ordinary course of its affairs, excluding taxes, but including: (i) the Marketing Fee&#59; (ii) the Administrator Fee, if any&#59; (iii) the Custodian Fee and fees for any other security vendor engaged by the Trust &#59; (iv) the Transfer Agent Fee&#59; (v) the Trustee fee&#59; (vi) fees and expenses related to the listing, quotation or trading of the Shares on any Secondary Market (including customary legal, marketing and audit fees and expenses) in an amount up to $600,000 in any given fiscal year&#59; (vii) ordinary course legal fees and expenses&#59; (viii) audit fees&#59; (ix) regulatory fees, including, if applicable, any fees relating to registration of the Shares under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act&#59; (x) printing and mailing costs&#59; (xi) the costs of maintaining the Trust&#8217;s website&#59; and (xii) applicable license fees (each a &#8220;Sponsor-paid Expense&#8221;), provided that any expense that qualifies as an Additional Trust Expense will be deemed to be an Additional Trust Expense and not a Sponsor-paid Expense. The Sponsor, from time to time, may temporarily waive all or a portion of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee of the Trust in its discretion for stated periods of time. Presently, the Sponsor does not intend to waive any of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee for the Trust. The Sponsor&#8217;s Fee will generally be paid in Bitcoins. However, if the Trust holds any Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency at any time, the Trust may also pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee, in whole or in part, with such Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency by entering into an agreement with the Sponsor and transferring such Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency to the Sponsor at a value to be determined pursuant to such agreement. However, the Trust may use Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency to pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee only if such agreement and transfer do not otherwise conflict with the terms of the Trust Agreement. The value of any such Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency will be determined on an arm&#8217;s-length basis. The Trust currently expects that the value of any such Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency would be determined by reference to an index provided by the Index Provider or, in the absence of such an index, by reference to the cascading set of rules described in &#8220;Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and Market&#8212;Bitcoin Value&#8212;The Index and the Index Price.&#8221; If the Trust pays the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee in Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency, in whole or in part, the amount of the relevant digital asset that would otherwise have been used to satisfy such payment will be correspondingly reduced. After the Trust&#8217;s payment of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee to the Sponsor, the Sponsor may elect to convert the Bitcoin, Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency received as payment of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee into U.S. dollars. The rate at which the Sponsor converts such Bitcoin, Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency to U.S. dollars may differ from the rate at which the relevant Sponsor&#8217;s Fee was determined. The Trust will not be responsible for any fees and expenses incurred by the Sponsor to convert Bitcoin, Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency received in payment of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee into U.S. dollars. Extraordinary and Other Expenses In certain extraordinary circumstances, the Trust may incur certain extraordinary, non-recurring expenses that are not Sponsor-paid Expenses, including, but not limited to: taxes and governmental charges&#59; expenses and costs of any extraordinary services performed by the Sponsor (or any other Service Provider) on behalf of the Trust to protect the Trust or the interests of shareholders (including in connection with any Incidental Rights and any IR Virtual Currency)&#59; any indemnification of the Custodian or other agents, service providers or counterparties of the Trust&#59; the fees and expenses related to the listing, quotation or trading of the Shares on any Secondary Market (including legal, marketing and audit fees and expenses) to the extent exceeding $600,000 in any given fiscal year&#59; and extraordinary legal fees and expenses, including any legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with litigation, regulatory enforcement or investigation matters (collectively, &#8220;Additional Trust Expenses&#8221;). If Additional Trust Expenses are incurred, the Trust will be required to pay these Additional Trust Expenses by selling or delivering Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency. The value of any such Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency will be determined on an arm&#8217;s-length basis. The Trust currently expects that the value of any such Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency would be determined by reference to an index provided by the Index Provider or, in the absence of such an index, by reference to the cascading set of rules described in &#8220;Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and Market&#8212;Bitcoin Value&#8212;The Index and the Index Price.&#8221; If the Trust pays Additional Trust Expenses in Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency, in whole or in part, the amount of Bitcoin that would otherwise have been used to satisfy such payment will be correspondingly reduced. See &#8220;&#8212;Disposition of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency&#8221; for further information on sales or other dispositions of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency. Although the Sponsor cannot definitively state the frequency or magnitude of Additional Trust Expenses, the Sponsor expects that they may occur infrequently. The Sponsor or any of its affiliates may be reimbursed only for the actual cost to the Sponsor or such affiliate of any expenses that it advances on behalf of the Trust for payment of which the Trust is responsible. In addition, the Trust Agreement prohibits the Trust from paying to the Sponsor or such affiliate for indirect expenses incurred in performing services for the Trust in its capacity as the Sponsor (or an affiliate of the Sponsor ) of the Trust, such as salaries and fringe benefits of officers and directors, rent or depreciation, utilities and other administrative items generally falling within the category of the Sponsor&#8217;s &#8220;overhead.&#8221; &#160;Disposition of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency To cause the Trust to pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee, the Sponsor will instruct the Custodian to (i) withdraw from the Digital Asset Account the number of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency, determined as described above in &#8220;&#8212;Expenses&#59; Sales of Bitcoins,&#8221; equal to the accrued but unpaid Sponsor&#8217;s Fee and (ii) transfer such Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency to an account maintained by the Custodian for the Sponsor at such times as the Sponsor determines in its absolute discretion. In addition, if the Trust incurs any Additional Trust Expenses, the Sponsor or its delegates (i) will instruct the Custodian to withdraw from the Digital Asset Account Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Trust Expenses and (ii) may either (x) cause the Trust to convert such Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency into U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies at the Actual Exchange Rate or (y) cause the Trust (or its delegate) to deliver such Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency in kind, in each case in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Trust Expenses. The Sponsor&#8217;s Fee and Additional Trust Expenses payable by the Trust will generally be paid in Bitcoin. Shareholders do not have the option of choosing to pay their proportionate shares of Additional Trust Expenses in lieu of having their shares of Additional Trust Expenses paid by the Trust&#8217;s delivery or disposition of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency. Assuming that the Trust is a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the transfer or sale of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency to pay the Trust&#8217;s expenses will be a taxable event for shareholders. See &#8220;Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences&#8212;Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders.&#8221; Because the number of Bitcoins held by the Trust will decrease as a consequence of the payment of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee in Bitcoins or the sale of Bitcoins to pay Additional Trust Expenses (and the Trust will incur additional fees associated with converting Bitcoins into U.S. dollars), the number of Bitcoins represented by a Share will decline at such time and the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings may also decrease. Similarly, the number (if any) of Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency represented by a Share will decrease as a consequence of the use of Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency to pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee and Additional Trust Expenses. Accordingly, the shareholders will bear the cost of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee and any Additional Trust Expenses. New Bitcoins deposited into the Digital Asset Account in exchange for additional new Baskets issued by the Trust will not reverse this trend. The Sponsor will also cause the sale of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency if the Sponsor determines that sale is required by applicable law or regulation or in connection with the termination and liquidation of the Trust. The Sponsor will not be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency.The quantity of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency to be delivered to the Sponsor or other relevant payee in payment of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee or any Additional Trust Expenses, or sold to permit payment of Additional Trust Expenses, will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trust&#8217;s expenses and the value of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency held by the Trust. Assuming that the Trust is a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each delivery or sale of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency by the Trust for the payment of expenses will be a taxable event to shareholders. See &#8220;&#8212;Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences&#8212;Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders.&#8221;&#160;Hypothetical Expense Example The following table illustrates the anticipated impact of the payment of the Trust&#8217;s expenses on the number of Bitcoins represented by each outstanding Share for three years, assuming that the Trust does not make any payments using any Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency. It assumes that the only transfers of Bitcoins will be those needed to pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee and that the price of Bitcoins and the number of Shares remain constant during the three-year period covered. The table does not show the impact of any Additional Trust Expenses. Any Additional Trust Expenses, if and when incurred, will accelerate the decrease in the fractional number of Bitcoins represented by each Share. In addition, the table does not show the effect of any waivers of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee that may be in effect from time to time. &#160;&#160;Year&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hypothetical price per Bitcoin&#160;$100.00&#160;&#160;$100.00&#160;&#160;$100.00&#160;Sponsor&#8217;s Fee&#160;&#160;2.00%&#160;&#160;2.00%&#160;&#160;2.00%Shares of Trust, beginning&#160;&#160;100,000.00&#160;&#160;&#160;100,000.00&#160;&#160;&#160;100,000.00&#160;Bitcoins in Trust, beginning&#160;&#160;10,000.00&#160;&#160;&#160;9,800.00&#160;&#160;&#160;9,604.00&#160;Hypothetical value of Bitcoins in Trust&#160;$1,000,000.00&#160;&#160;$980,000.00&#160;&#160;$960,400.00&#160;Beginning Digital Asset Holdings of the Trust&#160;$1,000,000.00&#160;&#160;$980,000.00&#160;&#160;$960,400.00&#160;Bitcoins to be delivered to cover the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;196.00&#160;&#160;&#160;192.08&#160;Bitcoins in Trust, ending&#160;&#160;9,800.00&#160;&#160;&#160;9,604.00&#160;&#160;&#160;9,411.92&#160;Ending Digital Asset Holdings of the Trust&#160;$980,000.00&#160;&#160;$960,400.00&#160;&#160;$941,192.00&#160;Ending Digital Asset Holdings per share&#160;$9.80&#160;&#160;$9.60&#160;&#160;$9.41&#160;Hypothetical price per Bitcoin&#160;$100.00&#160;&#160;$100.00&#160;&#160;$100.00&#160;&#160;Description of the Trust Agreement The following is a description of the material terms of the Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement establishes the roles, rights and duties of the Sponsor and the Trustee. The Sponsor Liability of the Sponsor and Indemnification The Sponsor and its affiliates (each a &#8220;Covered Person&#8221;) will not be liable to the Trust or any shareholder for any loss suffered by the Trust which arises out of any action or inaction of such Covered Person if such Covered Person determined in good faith that such course of conduct was in the best interests of the Trust. However, the preceding liability exclusion will not protect any Covered Person against any liability resulting from its own willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties. Each Covered Person will be indemnified by the Trust against any loss, judgment, liability, expense incurred or amount paid in settlement of any claim sustained by it in connection with the Covered Person&#8217;s activities for the Trust, provided that (i) the Covered Person was acting on behalf of, or performing services for, the Trust and had determined, in good faith, that such course of conduct was in the best interests of the Trust and such liability or loss was not the result of fraud, gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or a material breach of the Trust Agreement on the part of such Covered Person and (ii) any such indemnification will be recoverable only from the property of the Trust. Any amounts payable to an indemnified party will be payable in advance under certain circumstances. Fiduciary and Regulatory Duties of the Sponsor The Sponsor is not effectively subject to the duties and restrictions imposed on &#8220;fiduciaries&#8221; under both statutory and common law. Rather, the general fiduciary duties that would apply to the Sponsor are defined and limited in scope by the Trust Agreement. Under Delaware law, a shareholder may bring a derivative action if the shareholder is a shareholder at the time the action is brought and either (i) was a shareholder at the time of the transaction at issue or (ii) acquired the status of shareholder by operation of law or the Trust&#8217;s governing instrument from a person who was a shareholder at the time of the transaction at issue. Additionally, Section 3816(e) of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act specifically provides that &#8220;a beneficial owner&#8217;s right to bring a derivative action may be subject to such additional standards and restrictions, if any, as are set forth in the governing instrument of the statutory trust, including, without limitation, the requirement that beneficial owners owning a specified beneficial interest in the statutory trust join in the bringing of the derivative action.&#8221; In addition to the requirements of applicable law, the Trust Agreement provides that no shareholder will have the right, power or authority to bring or maintain a derivative action, suit or other proceeding on behalf of the Trust unless two or more shareholders who (i) are not &#8220;Affiliates&#8221; (as defined in the Trust Agreement and below) of one another and (ii) collectively hold at least 10.0% of the outstanding Shares join in the bringing or maintaining of such action, suit or other proceeding. The Trust selected the 10.0% ownership threshold because the Trust believed that this was a threshold that investors would be comfortable with based on market precedent. &#160;This provision applies to any derivative action brought in the name of the Trust other than claims brought under the federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder, to which Section 7.4 does not apply. Due to this additional requirement, a s hareholder attempting to bring a derivative action in the name of the Trust will be required to locate other s hareholders with which it is not affiliated and that have sufficient Shares to meet the 10.0% threshold based on the number of Shares outstanding on the date the claim is brought and thereafter throughout the duration of the action, suit or proceeding. &#8220;Affiliate&#8221; is defined in the Trust Agreement to mean any natural person, partnership, limited liability company, statutory trust, corporation, association or other legal entity (each, a &#8220;Person&#8221;) directly or indirectly owning, controlling or holding with power to vote 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of such Person, (ii) any Person 10% or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned, controlled or held with power to vote by such Person, (iii) any Person, directly or indirectly, controlling, controlled by or under common control of such Person, (iv) any employee, officer, director, member, manager or partner of such Person, or (v) if such Person is an employee, officer, director, member, manager or partner, any Person for which such Person acts in any such capacity. Any shareholders seeking to bring a derivative action may determine whether the 10.0% ownership threshold required to bring a derivative action has been met by dividing the number Shares owned by such shareholders by the total number of Shares outstanding. shareholders may determine the total number of Shares outstanding by reviewing the Trust&#8217;s annual filings on Form 10-K, quarterly filings on Form 10-Q and periodic reports on Form 8-K reporting sales of unregistered securities pursuant to Item 3.02 thereof, or by requesting the number of Shares outstanding at any time from the Sponsor pursuant to Sections 7.2 and 8.1 of the Trust Agreement and Section 3819(a) of the DSTA. Because the Trust is a grantor trust, it may only issue one class of securities, the Shares. The Trust offers Shares on a periodic basis at such times and for such periods as the Sponsor determines in its sole discretion. As a result, in order to maintain the 10.0% ownership threshold required to maintain a derivative action, shareholders may need to increase their holdings or locate additional shareholders during the pendency of a claim. The Trust posts the number of Shares outstanding as of the end of each month on its website and as of the end of each quarter in its annual and quarterly filings with the SEC. The Trust additionally reports sales of unregistered securities on Form 8-K pursuant to Item 3.02 thereof. Shareholders may monitor the number of Shares outstanding at any time for purposes of calculating their ownership threshold by reviewing the Trust&#8217;s website and SEC filings and by requesting the number of Shares outstanding on any date from the Sponsor at any time pursuant to Sections 7.2 and 8.1 of the Trust Agreement. Shareholders have the opportunity at any time to increase their holdings or locate other shareholders to maintain the 10.0% threshold throughout the duration of a derivative claim. Shareholders may do so by contacting shareholders that are required to file Schedule 13Ds or Schedule 13Gs with the SEC or by requesting from the Sponsor the list of the names and last known address of all shareholders pursuant to Sections 7.2 and 8.1 of the Trust Agreement and Section 3819(a) of the DSTA. The Sponsor is not aware of any reason to believe that Section 7.4 of the Trust Agreement is not enforceable under state or federal law. The Court of Chancery of Delaware has stated that &#8220;[t]he DSTA is enabling in nature and, as such, permits a trust through its declarations of trust to delineate additional standards and requirements with which a stockholder-plaintiff must comply to proceed derivatively in the name of the trust.&#8221; Hartsel v. Vanguard Group., Inc., Del. Ch. June 15, 2011. However, there is limited case law addressing the enforceability of provisions like Section 7.4 under state and federal law and it is possible that this provision would not be enforced by a court in another jurisdiction or under other circumstances. Beneficial owners may have the right, subject to certain legal requirements, to bring class actions in federal court to enforce their rights under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the SEC. Beneficial owners who have suffered losses in connection with the purchase or sale of their beneficial interests may be able to recover such losses from the Sponsor where the losses result from a violation by the Sponsor of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Actions Taken to Protect the Trust The Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, prosecute, defend, settle or compromise actions or claims at law or in equity that it considers necessary or proper to protect the Trust or the interests of the shareholders. The expenses incurred by the Sponsor in connection therewith (including the fees and disbursements of legal counsel) will be expenses of the Trust and are deemed to be Additional Trust Expenses. The Sponsor will be entitled to be reimbursed for the Additional Trust Expenses it pays on behalf of the Trust. &#160;Successor Sponsors If the Sponsor is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, the Trust may dissolve and a Liquidating Trustee may be appointed to terminate and liquidate the Trust and distribute its remaining assets. The Trustee will have no obligation to appoint a successor sponsor or to assume the duties of the Sponsor, and will have no liability to any person because the Trust is or is not terminated. However, if a certificate of dissolution or revocation of the Sponsor&#8217;s charter is filed (and ninety (90) days have passed after the date of notice to the Sponsor of revocation without a reinstatement of the Sponsor&#8217;s charter) or the withdrawal, removal, adjudication or admission of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Sponsor has occurred, shareholders holding at least a majority (over 50%) of the Shares may agree in writing to continue the affairs of the Trust and to select, effective as of the date of such event, one or more successor Sponsors within ninety (90) days of any such event. The Trustee The Trustee is a fiduciary under the Trust Agreement and must satisfy the requirements of Section 3807 of the Delaware Trust Statute. However, the fiduciary duties, responsibilities and liabilities of the Trustee are limited by, and are only those specifically set forth in, the Trust Agreement. Limitation on Trustee&#8217;s Liability Under the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor has exclusive control of the management of all aspects of the activities of the Trust and the Trustee has only nominal duties and liabilities to the Trust. The Trustee is appointed to serve as the trustee for the sole purpose of satisfying Section 3807(a) of the DSTA which requires that the Trust have at least one trustee with a principal place of business in the State of Delaware. The duties of the Trustee are limited to (i) accepting legal process served on the Trust in the State of Delaware and (ii) the execution of any certificates required to be filed with the Delaware Secretary of State which the Trustee is required to execute under the DSTA. To the extent the Trustee has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities to the Trust or the shareholders under the DSTA, such duties and liabilities will be replaced by the duties and liabilities of the Trustee expressly set forth in the Trust Agreement. The Trustee will have no obligation to supervise, nor will it be liable for, the acts or omissions of the Sponsor, Transfer Agent, Custodian or any other person. Neither the Trustee, either in its capacity as trustee or in its individual capacity, nor any director, officer or controlling person of the Trustee is, or has any liability as, the issuer, director, officer or controlling person of the issuer of Shares. The Trustee&#8217;s liability is limited solely to the express obligations of the Trustee as set forth in the Trust Agreement. Under the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor has the exclusive management, authority and control of all aspects of the activities of the Trust. The Trustee has no duty or liability to supervise or monitor the performance of the Sponsor, nor does the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of the Sponsor. The existence of a trustee should not be taken as an indication of any additional level of management or supervision over the Trust. The Trust Agreement provides that the management authority with respect to the Trust is vested directly in the Sponsor and that the Trustee is not responsible or liable for the genuineness, enforceability, collectability, value, sufficiency, location or existence of any of the Bitcoins or other assets of the Trust. Possible Repayment of Distributions Received by Shareholders&#59; Indemnification by Shareholders The Shares are limited liability investments. Investors may not lose more than the amount that they invest plus any profits recognized on their investment. Although it is unlikely, the Sponsor may, from time to time, make distributions to the shareholders. However, shareholders could be required, as a matter of bankruptcy law, to return to the estate of the Trust any distribution they received at a time when the Trust was in fact insolvent or in violation of its Trust Agreement. In addition, the Trust Agreement provides that shareholders will indemnify the Trust for any harm suffered by it as a result of shareholders&#8217; actions unrelated to the activities of the Trust. The foregoing repayment of distributions and indemnity provisions (other than the provision for shareholders indemnifying the Trust for taxes imposed upon it by a state, local or foreign taxing authority, which is included only as a formality due to the fact that many states do not have statutory trust statutes therefore the tax status of the Trust in such states might, theoretically, be challenged) are commonplace in statutory trusts and limited partnerships. &#160;Indemnification of the Trustee The Trustee and any of the officers, directors, employees and agents of the Trustee will be indemnified by the Trust as primary obligor and Digital Currency Group, Inc. as secondary obligor and held harmless against any loss, damage, liability, claim, action, suit, cost, expense, disbursement (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel), tax or penalty of any kind and nature whatsoever, arising out of, imposed upon or asserted at any time against such indemnified person in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Trust Agreement, the creation, operation or termination of the Trust or the transactions contemplated therein&#59; provided, however, that neither the Trust nor Digital Currency Group, Inc. will be required to indemnify any such indemnified person for any such expenses which are a result of the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of such indemnified person. If the Trust has insufficient assets or improperly refuses to pay such an indemnified person within 60 days of a request for payment owed under the Trust Agreement, Digital Currency Group, Inc. will, as secondary obligor, compensate or reimburse the Trustee or indemnify, defend and hold harmless such an indemnified person as if it were the primary obligor under the Trust Agreement. Any amount payable to such an indemnified person under the Trust Agreement may be payable in advance under certain circumstances and will be secured by a lien on the Trust property. The obligations of Digital Currency Group, Inc. and the Trust to indemnify such indemnified persons under the Trust Agreement will survive the termination of the Trust Agreement. Holding of Trust Property The Trust will hold and record the ownership of the Trust&#8217;s assets in a manner such that it will be owned for the benefit of the shareholders for the purposes of, and subject to and limited by the terms and conditions set forth in, the Trust Agreement. The Trust will not create, incur or assume any indebtedness or borrow money from or loan money to any person. The Trustee may not commingle its assets with those of any other person. The Trustee may employ agents, attorneys, accountants, auditors and nominees and will not be answerable for the conduct or misconduct of any such custodians, agents, attorneys or nominees if such custodians, agents, attorneys and nominees have been selected with reasonable care. Resignation, Discharge or Removal of Trustee&#59; Successor Trustees The Trustee may resign as Trustee by written notice of its election so to do, delivered to the Sponsor with at least 180 days&#8217; notice. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee in its discretion. If the Trustee resigns or is removed, the Sponsor, acting on behalf of the shareholders, will appoint a successor trustee. The successor Trustee will become fully vested with all of the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the outgoing Trustee. If the Trustee resigns and no successor trustee is appointed within 180 days after the Trustee notifies the Sponsor of its resignation, the Trustee will terminate and liquidate the Trust and distribute its remaining assets. Amendments to the Trust Agreement In general, the Sponsor may amend the Trust Agreement without the consent of any shareholder. In particular, the Sponsor may, without the approval of the shareholders, amend the Trust Agreement if the Trust is advised at any time by the Trust&#8217;s accountants or legal counsel that the amendments are necessary to permit the Trust to take the position that it is a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, the Sponsor may not make an amendment, or otherwise supplement the Trust Agreement, if such amendment or supplement would permit the Sponsor, the Trustee or any other person to vary the investment of the shareholders (within the meaning of applicable Treasury Regulations) or would otherwise adversely affect the status of the Trust as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, no amendments to the Trust Agreement that materially adversely affect the interests of shareholders may be made without the vote of at least a majority (over 50%) of the Shares (not including any Shares held by the Sponsor or its affiliates). A shareholder will be deemed to have consented to a modification or amendment of the Trust Agreement if the Sponsor has notified the shareholders in writing of the proposed modification or amendment and the shareholder has not, within 20 calendar days of such notice, notified the Sponsor in writing the shareholder objects to such modification or amendment. Termination of the Trust The Trust will dissolve if any of the following events occur: &#160;&#8226; a U.S. federal or state regulator requires the Trust to shut down or forces the Trust to liquidate its Bitcoins or seizes, impounds or otherwise restricts access to Trust assets&#59; &#160;&#8226; any ongoing event exists that either prevents the Trust from making or makes impractical the Trust&#8217;s reasonable efforts to make a fair determination of the Index Price&#59; &#160;&#160;&#8226; any ongoing event exists that either prevents the Trust from converting or makes impractical the Trust&#8217;s reasonable efforts to convert Bitcoins to U.S. dollars&#59; or &#160;&#8226; a certificate of dissolution or revocation of the Sponsor&#8217;s charter is filed (and 90 days have passed since the date of notice to the Sponsor of revocation without a reinstatement of its charter) or the withdrawal, removal, adjudication or admission of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Sponsor has occurred, unless (i) at the time there is at least one remaining Sponsor and that remaining Sponsor carries on the Trust or (ii) within 90 days of any such event shareholders holding at least a majority (over 50%) of Shares, not including Shares held by the Sponsor and its affiliates, agree in writing to continue the activities of the Trust and to select, effective as of the date of such event, one or more successor Sponsors. The Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, dissolve the Trust if any of the following events occur: &#160;&#8226; the SEC determines that the Trust is an investment company required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940&#59; &#160;&#8226; the CFTC determines that the Trust is a commodity pool under the CEA&#59; &#160;&#8226; the Trust is determined to be a &#8220;money service business&#8221; under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and is required to comply with certain FinCEN regulations thereunder&#59; &#160;&#8226; the Trust is required to obtain a license or make a registration under any state law regulating money transmitters, money services businesses, providers of prepaid or stored value or similar entities, or virtual currency businesses&#59; &#160;&#8226; the Trust becomes insolvent or bankrupt&#59; &#160;&#8226; the Custodian resigns or is removed without replacement&#59; &#160;&#8226; all of the Trust&#8217;s assets are sold&#59; &#160;&#8226; the Sponsor determines that the aggregate net assets of the Trust in relation to the expenses of the Trust make it unreasonable or imprudent to continue the affairs of the Trust&#59; &#160;&#8226; the Sponsor receives notice from the IRS or from counsel for the Trust or the Sponsor that the Trust fails to qualify for treatment, or will not be treated, as a grantor trust under the Code&#59; &#160;&#8226; if the Trustee notifies the Sponsor of the Trustee&#8217;s election to resign and the Sponsor does not appoint a successor trustee within 180 days&#59; or &#160;&#8226; the Sponsor determines, in its sole discretion, that it is desirable or advisable for any reason to discontinue the affairs of the Trust. The Sponsor may determine that it is desirable or advisable to discontinue the affairs of the Trust for a variety of reasons. For example, the Sponsor may terminate the Trust if the digital asset held by such Trust were asserted, or ultimately determined, to be a security under the federal securities laws by the SEC or a federal court.The death, legal disability, bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution, or withdrawal of any shareholder (as long as such shareholder is not the sole shareholder of the Trust) will not result in the termination of the Trust, and such shareholder, his or her estate, custodian or personal representative will have no right to a redemption or value such shareholder&#8217;s Shares. Each shareholder (and any assignee thereof) expressly agrees that in the event of his or her death, he or she waives on behalf of himself or herself and his or her estate, and he or she directs the legal representative of his or her estate and any person interested therein to waive the furnishing of any inventory, accounting or appraisal of the assets of the Trust and any right to an audit or examination of the books of account for the Trust, except for such rights as are set forth in Article VIII of the Trust Agreement relating to the books of account and reports of the Trust. Upon dissolution of the Trust and surrender of Shares by the shareholders, shareholders will receive a distribution in U.S. dollars or Bitcoin, Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency, at the sole discretion of the Sponsor, after the Sponsor has sold the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin, Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency, if applicable, and has paid or made provision for the Trust&#8217;s claims and obligations. If the Trust is forced to liquidate, the Trust will be liquidated under the Sponsor&#8217;s direction. The Sponsor, on behalf of the Trust, will engage directly with Digital Asset Markets to liquidate the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin as promptly as possible while obtaining the best fair value possible. The proceeds therefrom will be applied and distributed in the following order of priority: (a) to the expenses of liquidation and termination and to creditors, including shareholders who are creditors, to the extent otherwise permitted by law, in satisfaction of liabilities of the Trust other than liabilities for distributions to shareholders and (b) to the holders of Shares pro rata in accordance with the respective percentage of percentages of Shares that they hold. It is expected that the Sponsor would be subject to &#160;the same regulatory requirements as the Trust, and therefore, the markets available to the Sponsor will be the same markets available to the Trust. Governing Law The Trust Agreement and the rights of the Sponsor, Trustee and shareholders under the Trust Agreement are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. Each Participant Agreement is also governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. Description of the Custodian Agreement The Custodian Agreement establishes the rights and responsibilities of the Custodian, Sponsor, Trust and Authorized Participants with respect to the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin in the Digital Asset Account, which is maintained and operated by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust. For a general description of the Custodian&#8217;s obligations, see &#8220;&#8212;Service Providers of the Trust&#8212;The Custodian.&#8221; Account&#59; Location of Bitcoins The Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Account is a segregated custody account controlled and secured by the Custodian to store private keys, which allow for the transfer of ownership or control of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin, on the Trust&#8217;s behalf. Private key shards associated with the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin are distributed geographically by the Custodian in secure vaults around the world, including in the United States. The locations of the secure vaults may change regularly and are kept confidential by the Custodian for security purposes. The Custodian requires written approval of the Trust prior to changing the location of the private key shards, and therefore the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin, including to a different state. The Digital Asset Account uses offline storage, or cold storage, mechanisms to secure the Trust&#8217;s private keys. The term cold storage refers to a safeguarding method by which the private keys corresponding to digital assets are disconnected and\/or deleted entirely from the internet. Bitcoin in the Digital Asset Account are not treated as general assets of the Custodian. Rather, the Custodian serves as a fiduciary and custodian on the Trust&#8217;s behalf, and the Bitcoin in the Digital Asset Account are considered fiduciary assets that remain the Trust&#8217;s property at all times. Safekeeping of Bitcoins The Custodian will use best efforts to keep in safe custody on behalf of the Trust all Bitcoin received by the Custodian. All Bitcoin credited to the Digital Asset Account will (i) be held in the Digital Asset Account at all times, and the Digital Asset Account will be controlled by the Custodian&#59; (ii) be labeled or otherwise appropriately identified as being held for the Trust&#59; (iii) be held in the Digital Asset Account on a non-fungible basis&#59; (iv) not be commingled with other digital assets held by the Custodian, whether held for the Custodian&#8217;s own account or the account of other clients other than the Trust&#59; (v) not without the prior written consent of the Trust be deposited or held with any third-party depositary, custodian, clearance system or wallet&#59; and (vi) for any Digital Asset Account maintained by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust, the Custodian will use best efforts to keep the private key or keys secure, and will not disclose such keys to the Trust, the Sponsor or to any other individual or entity except to the extent that any keys are disclosed consistent with a standard of best efforts and as part of a multiple signature solution that would not result in the Trust or the Sponsor &#8220;storing, holding, or maintaining custody or control of&#8221; the Bitcoin &#8220;on behalf of others&#8221; within the meaning of the New York BitLicense Rule (23 NYCRR Part 200) as in effect as of June 24, 2015 such that it would require the Trust or the Sponsor to become licensed under such law. Insurance The Custodian has indicated to the Sponsor that it has insurance coverage as a subsidiary under its parent company, Coinbase Global, Inc. (together with its affiliates, &#8220;Coinbase&#8221;), which procures fidelity (aka crime) insurance coverage of up to $255 million. The Custodian&#8217;s insurance coverage is limited to losses of the digital assets it custodies on behalf of its clients, including the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin, resulting from theft, including internal theft by employees of Coinbase and theft or fraud by a director if the director is acting in the capacity of an employee of Coinbase. Deposits, Withdrawals and Storage&#59; Access to the Digital Asset Account The Custodial Services (i) allow Bitcoin to be deposited from a public blockchain address to the Digital Asset Account and (ii) allow the Trust or Sponsor to withdraw Bitcoin from the Digital Asset Account to a public blockchain address the Trust or the Sponsor controls (each such transaction is a &#8220;Custody Transaction&#8221;). &#160;The Custodian reserves the right to refuse to process or to cancel any pending Custody Transaction as required by law or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order or to enforce transaction, threshold, and condition limits, in each case as communicated to the Trust and the Sponsor as soon as reasonably practicable where the Custodian is permitted to do so, or if the Custodian reasonably believes that the Custody Transaction may violate or facilitate the violation of an applicable law, regulation or applicable rule of a governmental authority or self-regulatory organization. The Custodian may suspend or restrict the Trust&#8217;s and Sponsor&#8217;s access to the Custodial Services, and\/or deactivate, terminate or cancel the Digital Asset Account if the Trust or Sponsor has taken certain actions, including any Prohibited Use or Prohibited Business as set forth in the Custodian Agreement. From the time the Custodian has verified the authorization of a complete set of instructions to withdraw Bitcoins from the Digital Asset Account, the Custodian will have up to forty-eight (48) hours to process and complete such withdrawal. The Custodian will ensure that initiated deposits are processed in a timely manner but the Custodian makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing which is dependent upon many factors outside of the Custodian&#8217;s control. Subject to certain exceptions in the Custodian Agreement, the Trust, the Sponsor and their authorized representatives will be able to access the Digital Asset Account via the Custodian&#8217;s website 99.9% of the time (excluding scheduled maintenance) in order to check information about the Digital Asset Account, deposit Bitcoin to the Digital Asset Account or initiate a Custody Transaction (subject to the timing described above). The Custodian makes no other representations or warranties with respect to the availability and\/or accessibility of Bitcoin or the availability and\/or accessibility of the Digital Asset Account or Custodial Services. Subject to any legal and regulatory requirements, in order to support the Trust&#8217;s ordinary course of deposits and withdrawals, which involves, or will in the future involve, deposits from and withdrawals to Digital Asset accounts owned by any Authorized Participant, the Custodian will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Trust and Sponsor to design and put in place via the Custodial Services a secure procedure to allow Authorized Participants to receive a Bitcoin address for deposits by Authorized Participants, and to initiate withdrawals to Bitcoin addresses controlled by Authorized Participants. The Custodian Agreement further provides that the Trust&#8217;s and the Sponsor&#8217;s auditors or third-party accountants upon reasonable notice, have inspection rights to visit and inspect the Digital Asset Account. Such auditors or third-party accountants are not obligated under the Custodian Agreement to exercise their inspection rights. Security of the Account The Custodian securely stores all digital asset private keys held by the Custodian in offline storage. Under the Custodian Agreement, the Custodian must use best efforts to keep private and public keys secure, and may not disclose private keys to the Sponsor, Trust or any other individual or entity. The Custodian has implemented and will maintain a reasonable information security program that includes policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to safeguard the Custodian&#8217;s electronic systems and the Trust&#8217;s and the Sponsor&#8217;s confidential information from, among other things, unauthorized access or misuse. In the event of a Data Security Event (as defined below), the Custodian will promptly (subject to any legal or regulatory requirements) notify the Trust and the Sponsor. &#8220;Data Security Event&#8221; is defined as any event whereby (a) an unauthorized person (whether within the Custodian or a third party) acquired or accessed the Trust&#8217;s or the Sponsor&#8217;s information, (b) the Trust&#8217;s or the Sponsor&#8217;s information is otherwise lost, stolen or compromised or (c) the Custodian&#8217;s Chief Information Security Officer, or other senior security officer of a similar title, is no longer employed by the Custodian . Record Keeping&#59; Inspection and Auditing The Custodian will keep timely and accurate records of its services pursuant to the Custodian Agreement, and such records must be retained by the Custodian for no less than seven years. The Custodian Agreement also provides that the Custodian will permit, to the extent it may legally do so, the Trust&#8217;s or the Sponsor&#8217;s auditors or third-party accountants, upon reasonable notice, to inspect, take extracts from and audit the records that it maintains, take such steps as necessary to verify that satisfactory internal control system and procedures are in place, and visit and inspect the systems on which the Bitcoins are held, all at such times as the Trust or the Sponsor may reasonably request. The Custodian is obligated to provide a copy of any audit report prepared by its internal or independent auditors to the Trust or the Sponsor, pursuant to the Custodian&#8217;s annual audit or otherwise. &#160;Annual Certificate and Report Once each calendar year, the Sponsor or Trust may request that the Custodian deliver a certificate signed by a duly authorized officer to certify that the Custodian has complied and is currently in compliance with the Custodian Agreement and that all representations and warranties made by the Custodian in the Custodian Agreement are true and correct on and as of the date of such certificate, and have been true and correct throughout the preceding year. For year 2020, and thereafter, no more than once per calendar year, the Trust and the Sponsor will be entitled to request that the Custodian produce or commission a new Services Organization Controls (&#8220;SOC&#8221;) 1 report and SOC 2 report, and promptly deliver to the Trust and the Sponsor a copy thereof by December 31 of each year. The Custodian reserves the right to combine the SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports into a comprehensive report. In the event that the Custodian does not deliver a SOC 1 Report or SOC 2 Report, as applicable, the Sponsor and the Trust will be entitled to terminate the Agreement. Standard of Care&#59; Limitations of Liability The Custodian will use best efforts to keep in safe custody on behalf of the Trust all Bitcoin received by the Custodian. The Custodian is liable to the Sponsor and the Trust for the loss of any Bitcoin to the extent that the Custodian directly caused such loss (including if the Trust or the Sponsor is not able to timely withdraw Bitcoin from the Digital Asset Account according to the Custodian Agreement or as a result of the Custodian&#8217;s errors in executing a transaction on behalf of the Trust), even if the Custodian meets its duty of exercising best efforts, and the Custodian is required to return to the Trust a quantity equal to the quantity of any such lost Bitcoin. The Custodian&#8217;s or Trust&#8217;s total liability under the Custodian Agreement will never exceed the value of the Bitcoin on deposit in the Digital Asset Account at the time of, and directly relating to, the events giving rise to the liability occurred, the value of which will be determined in accordance with the Custodian Agreement. In addition, for as long as a cold storage address holds Bitcoin with a value in excess of $100 million (the &#8220;Cold Storage Threshold&#8221;) for a period of five consecutive business days or more without being reduced to the Cold Storage Threshold or lower, the Custodian&#8217;s maximum liability for such cold storage address shall be limited to the Cold Storage Threshold. The Sponsor monitors the value of Bitcoins deposited in cold storage addresses for whether the Cold Storage Threshold has been met by determining the U.S. dollar value of Bitcoins deposited in each cold storage address on business days. The Custodian or Trust are not liable to each other for any lost profits or any special, incidental, indirect, intangible, or consequential damages, whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, and whether or not the Custodian has been advised of such losses or the Custodian knew or should have known of the possibility of such damages. Furthermore, the Custodian is not liable for delays, suspension of operations, whether temporary or permanent, failure in performance, or interruption of service which result directly or indirectly from any cause or condition beyond the reasonable control of the Custodian, including but not limited to, any delay or failure due to any act of God, natural disasters, act of civil or military authorities, act of terrorists, including but not limited to cyber-related terrorist acts, hacking, government restrictions, exchange or market rulings, civil disturbance, war, strike or other labor dispute, fire, interruption in telecommunications or Internet services or network provider services, failure of equipment and\/or software, other catastrophe or any other occurrence which is beyond the reasonable control of the Custodian and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. For the avoidance of doubt, a cybersecurity attack, hack or other intrusion by a third party or by someone associated with the Custodian is not a circumstance that is beyond the Custodian&#8217;s reasonable control, to the extent due to the Custodian&#8217;s failure to comply with its obligations under the Custodian Agreement. The Custodian does not bear any liability, whatsoever, for any damage or interruptions caused by any computer viruses, spyware, scareware, Trojan horses, worms or other malware that may affect the Sponsor&#8217;s or the Trust&#8217;s computer or other equipment, or any phishing, spoofing or other attack, unless such damage or interruption originated from the Custodian due to its gross negligence, fraud, willful misconduct or breach of the Custodian Agreement. Indemnity Each of the Custodian and the Trust has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the other such parties from any third-party claim or third-party demand (including reasonable and documented attorneys&#8217; fees and any fines, fees or penalties imposed by any regulatory authority) arising out of or related to the Custodian&#8217;s or the Trust&#8217;s, as the case may be, breach of the Custodian Agreement, inaccuracy in any of the Custodian&#8217;s or the Trust&#8217;s, as the case may be, representations or warranties in the Custodian Agreement, or the Custodian&#8217;s or the Trust&#8217;s, as the case may be, knowing, in the case of the Custodian, violation of any law, rule or regulation, or the rights of any third party, except where such claim directly results from the gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of the other such party. &#160;Fees and Expenses The Custodian Fee is an annualized fee charged monthly that is a percentage of the Trust&#8217;s monthly assets under custody. Following the third anniversary of the Custodian Agreement, the fee may be adjusted by the Custodian with at least six months&#8217; advance notice. Any changes to the fee will be agreed to by the Trust and the Sponsor and the Custodian in writing. To the extent the parties cannot reach an agreement regarding any modifications in pricing, either party may elect to terminate the Custodian Agreement. It is the Trust&#8217;s and the Sponsor&#8217;s sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any deposits or withdrawals conducted through the Custodial Services. Term&#59; Renewal Subject to each party&#8217;s termination rights, the Custodian Agreement is for a term of three years. Thereafter, the Custodian Agreement automatically renews for successive terms of one year, unless either party elects not to renew, by providing no less than thirty days&#8217; written notice to the other party prior to the expiration of the then-current term, or unless terminated earlier as provided herein. Termination During the Initial Term, either party may terminate the Custodian Agreement for Cause (as defined below) at any time by written notice to the other party, effective immediately, or on such later date as may be specified in the notice. &#8220;Cause&#8221; is defined as if: (i) such other party commits any material breach of any of its obligations under the Custodian Agreement&#59; (ii) such other party is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or there is commenced against such party a case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or such party files an application for an arrangement with its creditors, seeks or consents to the appointment of a receiver, administrator or other similar official for all or any substantial part of its property, admits in writing its inability to pay its debts as they mature, or takes any corporate action in furtherance of any of the foregoing, or fails to meet applicable legal minimum capital requirements&#59; or (iii) with respect to the Trust&#8217;s and the Sponsor&#8217;s right to terminate, any applicable law, rule or regulation or any change therein or in the interpretation or administration thereof has or may have a material adverse effect on the rights of the Trust, the Sponsor or any of their respective beneficiaries with respect to any services covered by the Custodian Agreement. After the initial term, either party may terminate the Custodian Agreement (i) upon ninety (90) days&#8217; prior written notice to the other party and (ii) for Cause at any time by written notice to the other party, effective immediately, or on such later date as may be specified in the notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor and the Trust may cancel the Digital Asset Account at any time by withdrawing all balances and contacting the Custodian. Upon termination of the Custodian Agreement, the Custodian will promptly upon the Sponsor&#8217;s or the Trust&#8217;s order deliver or cause to be delivered all digital assets held or controlled by the Custodian as of the effective date of termination, together with such copies of the records maintained pursuant to the Custodian Agreement and as the Sponsor and the Trust requests in writing. Governing Law The Custodian Agreement is governed by New York law. Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsequencesThe following discussion addresses the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership of Shares. This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to a beneficial owner of Shares in light of the beneficial owner&#8217;s particular circumstances, including tax consequences applicable to beneficial owners subject to special rules, such as: &#160;&#8226; financial institutions&#59; &#160;&#8226; dealers in securities or commodities&#59; &#160;&#8226; traders in securities or commodities that have elected to apply a mark-to-market method of tax accounting in respect thereof&#59; &#160;&#8226; persons holding Shares as part of a hedge, &#8220;straddle,&#8221; integrated transaction or similar transaction&#59; &#160;&#8226; Authorized Participants (as defined below)&#59; &#160;&#8226; U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar&#59; &#160;&#8226; entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes&#59; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#8226; real estate investment trusts&#59; &#160;&#8226; regulated investment companies&#59; and &#160;&#8226; tax-exempt entities, including individual retirement accounts. This discussion applies only to Shares that are held as capital assets and does not address alternative minimum tax consequences or consequences of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. If an entity or arrangement that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Shares, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding Shares and partners in those partnerships are urged to consult their tax advisers about the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning Shares. This discussion is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations as of the date hereof, changes to any of which subsequent to the date hereof may affect the tax consequences described herein. For the avoidance of doubt, this summary does not discuss any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. Shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisers about the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. Tax Treatment of the Trust The Sponsor intends to take the position that the Trust is properly treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming that the Trust is a grantor trust, the Trust will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Rather, if the Trust is a grantor trust, each beneficial owner of Shares will be treated as directly owning its pro rata share of the Trust&#8217;s assets and a pro rata portion of the Trust&#8217;s income, gain, losses and deductions will &#8220;flow through&#8221; to each beneficial owner of Shares. The Trust has taken certain positions with respect to the tax consequences of Incidental Rights and its receipt of IR Virtual Currency. If the IRS were to disagree with, and successfully challenge, any of these positions, the Trust might not qualify as a grantor trust. In addition, the Sponsor has delivered the Prospective Abandonment Notices to the former custodian and the Custodian, stating that the Trust is irrevocably abandoning, effective immediately prior to each Creation Time, all Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency to which it would otherwise be entitled as of such time and with respect to which it has not taken any Affirmative Action at or prior to such time. The Trust has also abandoned Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency through Affirmative Actions. There can be no complete assurance that these abandonments will be treated as effective for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Trust were treated as owning any asset other than Bitcoins as of any date on which it creates Shares, it would likely cease to qualify as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes . Because of the evolving nature of digital currencies, it is not possible to predict potential future developments that may arise with respect to digital currencies, including forks, airdrops and other similar occurrences. Assuming that the Trust is currently a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, certain future developments could render it impossible, or impracticable, for the Trust to continue to be treated as a grantor trust for such purposes. If the Trust is not properly classified as a grantor trust, the Trust might be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, due to the uncertain treatment of digital currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance in this regard. If the Trust were classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax consequences of owning Shares generally would not be materially different from the tax consequences described herein, although there might be certain differences, including with respect to timing of the recognition of taxable income or loss. In addition, tax information reports provided to beneficial owners of Shares would be made in a different form. If the Trust were not classified as either a grantor trust or a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be classified as a corporation for such purposes. In that event, the Trust would be subject to entity-level U.S. federal income tax (currently at the rate of 21%) on its net taxable income and certain distributions made by the Trust to shareholders would be treated as taxable dividends to the extent of the Trust&#8217;s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Any such dividend distributed to a beneficial owner of Shares that is a non-U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as provided in an applicable tax treaty). The remainder of this discussion is based on the assumption that the Trust will be treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. &#160;Uncertainty Regarding the U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Digital Currency Each beneficial owner of Shares will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of an undivided interest in the Bitcoins (and any Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency) held in the Trust. Due to the new and evolving nature of digital currencies and the absence of comprehensive guidance with respect to digital currencies, many significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of digital currency are uncertain. In 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) released a notice (the &#8220;Notice&#8221;) discussing certain aspects of the treatment of &#8220;convertible virtual currency&#8221; (that is, digital currency that has an equivalent value in fiat currency or that acts as a substitute for fiat currency) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the Notice, the IRS stated that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such digital currency (i) is &#8220;property,&#8221; (ii) is not &#8220;currency&#8221; for purposes of the provisions of the Code relating to foreign currency gain or loss and (iii) may be held as a capital asset. In 2019, the IRS released a revenue ruling and a set of &#8220;Frequently Asked Questions&#8221; (the &#8220;Ruling &#38; FAQs&#8221;) that provide some additional guidance, including guidance to the effect that, under certain circumstances, hard forks of digital currencies are taxable events giving rise to ordinary income and guidance with respect to the determination of the tax basis of digital currency. However, the Notice and the Ruling &#38; FAQs do not address other significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of digital currencies. Moreover, although the Ruling &#38; FAQs address the treatment of hard forks, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of the income inclusions. While the Ruling &#38; FAQs do not address most situations in which airdrops occur, it is clear from the reasoning of the Ruling &#38; FAQs that the IRS generally would treat an airdrop as a taxable event giving rise to ordinary income. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not alter its position with respect to digital currencies in the future or that a court would uphold the treatment set forth in the Notice and the Ruling &#38; FAQs. It is also unclear what additional guidance on the treatment of digital currencies for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be issued in the future. Any such alteration of the current IRS positions or additional guidance could result in adverse tax consequences for shareholders and could have an adverse effect on the prices of digital currencies, including the price of Bitcoin in the Digital Asset Market, and therefore could have an adverse effect on the value of Shares. Future developments that may arise with respect to digital currencies may increase the uncertainty with respect to the treatment of digital currencies for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For example, the Notice addresses only digital currency that is &#8220;convertible virtual currency,&#8221; and it is conceivable that, as a result of a fork, airdrop or similar occurrence, a Trust will hold certain types of digital currency that are not within the scope of the Notice.The remainder of this discussion assumes that Bitcoin, and any Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency that the Trust may hold, is properly treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as property that may be held as a capital asset and that is not currency for purposes of the provisions of the Code relating to foreign currency gain and loss. Shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the tax consequences of an investment in the Trust and in digital currencies in general, including, in the case of shareholders that are generally exempt from U.S. federal income taxation, whether such shareholders may recognize &#8220;unrelated business taxable income&#8221; (&#8220;UBTI&#8221;) as a consequence of a fork, airdrop or similar occurrence. Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency It is possible that, in the future, the Trust will hold Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency that it receives in connection with its investment in Bitcoins. The uncertainties with respect to the treatment of digital currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes, described above, apply to Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency, as well as to Bitcoins. As described above, the Notice addressed only digital currency that is &#8220;convertible virtual currency,&#8221; defined as digital currency that has an equivalent value in fiat currency or that acts as a substitute for fiat currency. It is conceivable that certain IR Virtual Currency the Trust may receive in the future would not be within the scope of the Notice. In general, it is expected that the Trust would receive Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency as a consequence of a fork, an airdrop or a similar occurrence related to its ownership of Bitcoins. As described above, the Ruling &#38; FAQs include guidance to the effect that, under certain circumstances, forks (and, presumably, airdrops) of digital currencies are taxable events giving rise to ordinary income, but there continues to be uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of the income inclusions. The Trust&#8217;s receipt of Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency may give rise to other tax issues. The possibility that the Trust will receive Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency thus increases the uncertainties and risks with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in Shares. &#160;The Trust may distribute Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency, or cash from the sale of Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency, to the s hareholders. Alternatively, the Trust may form a liquidating trust to which it contributes Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency and distribute interests in the liquidating trust to the s hareholders. Any such distribution will not be a taxable event for a U.S. Holder (as defined below). A U.S. Holder&#8217;s tax basis in the Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency distributed, whether directly or through the medium of a liquidating trust, will be the same as the U.S. Holder&#8217;s tax basis in the distributed assets immediately prior to the distribution, and the U.S. Holder&#8217;s tax basis in its pro rata share of the Trust&#8217;s remaining assets will not include the amount of such basis. Immediately after any such distribution, the U.S. Holder&#8217;s holding period with respect to the distributed Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency will be the same as the U.S. Holder&#8217;s holding period with respect to the distributed assets immediately prior to the distribution. A subsequent sale of the distributed Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency will generally be a taxable event for a U.S. Holder. For simplicity of presentation, the remainder of this discussion assumes that the Trust will hold only Bitcoins. However, the principles set forth in the discussion below apply to all of the assets that the Trust may hold at any time, including Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency, as well as Bitcoins. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each beneficial owner of Shares generally will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as owning an undivided interest in any Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency held in the Trust, and any transfers or sales of Incidental Rights and\/or IR Virtual Currency by the Trust (other than distributions by the Trust, as described in the preceding paragraph) will be taxable events to shareholders with respect to which shareholders will generally recognize gain or loss in a manner similar to the recognition of gain or loss on a taxable disposition of Bitcoins, as described below. Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders As used herein, the term &#8220;U.S. Holder&#8221; means a beneficial owner of a Share for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is: &#160;&#8226; an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes&#59; &#160;&#8226; a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision thereof&#59; or &#160;&#8226; an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source. Except as specifically noted, the discussion below assumes that each U.S. Holder will acquire all of its Shares on the same date for the same price per Share and either solely for cash or solely for Bitcoins that were originally acquired by the U.S. Holder for cash on the same date. As discussed in the section entitled &#8220;Description of Creation of Shares,&#8221; a U.S. Holder may be able to acquire Shares of the Trust by contributing Bitcoins in-kind to the Trust (either directly or through an Authorized Participant acting as agent of the U.S. Holder). Assuming that the Trust is properly treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such a contribution should not be a taxable event to the U.S. Holder. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, each U.S. Holder will be treated as owning an undivided interest in the Bitcoins held in the Trust and will be treated as directly realizing its pro rata share of the Trust&#8217;s income, gains, losses and deductions. When a U.S. Holder purchases Shares solely for cash, (i) the U.S. Holder&#8217;s initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the Bitcoins held in the Trust will be equal to the amount paid for the Shares and (ii) the U.S. Holder&#8217;s holding period for its pro rata share of such Bitcoins will begin on the date of such purchase. When a U.S. Holder acquires Shares in exchange for Bitcoins, (i) the U.S. Holder&#8217;s initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the Bitcoins held in the Trust will be equal to the U.S. Holder&#8217;s tax basis in the Bitcoins that the U.S. Holder transferred to the Trust and (ii) the U.S. Holder&#8217;s holding period for its pro rata share of such Bitcoins generally will include the period during which the U.S. Holder held the Bitcoins that the U.S. Holder transferred to the Trust. The Ruling &#38; FAQs confirm that if a taxpayer acquires tokens of a digital currency at different times and for different prices, the taxpayer has a separate tax basis in each lot of such tokens. Under the Ruling &#38; FAQs, if a U.S. Holder that owns more than one lot of Bitcoins contributes a portion of its Bitcoins to the Trust in exchange for Shares, the U.S. Holder may designate the lot(s) from which such contribution will be made, provided that the U.S. Holder is able to identify specifically which Bitcoins it is contributing and to substantiate its tax basis in those Bitcoins. In general, if a U.S. Holder acquires Shares (i) solely for cash at different prices, (ii) partly for cash and partly in exchange for a contribution of Bitcoins or (iii) in exchange for a contribution of Bitcoins with different tax bases, the U.S. Holder&#8217;s share of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins will consist of separate lots with separate tax bases. In addition, in this situation, the U.S. Holder&#8217;s holding period for the separate lots may be different. In addition, the IR Virtual Currency that the Trust acquires in a hard fork or airdrop that is treated as a taxable event will constitute a separate lot with a separate tax basis and holding period. &#160;When the Trust transfers Bitcoins to the Sponsor as payment of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee, or sells Bitcoins to fund payment of any Additional Trust Expenses, each U.S. Holder will be treated as having sold its pro rata share of those Bitcoins for their fair market value at that time (which, in the case of Bitcoins sold by the Trust, generally will be equal to the cash proceeds received by the Trust in respect thereof). As a result, each U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the fair market value of the U.S. Holder&#8217;s pro rata share of the Bitcoins transferred and (ii) the U.S. Holder&#8217;s tax basis for its pro rata share of the Bitcoins transferred. Any such gain or loss will be short-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder&#8217;s holding period for its pro rata share of the Bitcoins is one year or less and long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder&#8217;s holding period for its pro rata share of the Bitcoins is more than one year. A U.S. Holder&#8217;s tax basis in its pro rata share of any Bitcoins transferred by the Trust generally will be determined by multiplying the tax basis of the U.S. Holder&#8217;s pro rata share of all of the Bitcoins held in the Trust immediately prior to the transfer by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of Bitcoins transferred and the denominator of which is the total amount of Bitcoins held in the Trust immediately prior to the transfer. Immediately after the transfer, the U.S. Holder&#8217;s tax basis in its pro rata share of the Bitcoins remaining in the Trust will be equal to the tax basis of its pro rata share of the Bitcoins held in the Trust immediately prior to the transfer, less the portion of that tax basis allocable to its pro rata share of the Bitcoins transferred. As noted above, the IRS has taken the position in the Ruling &#38; FAQs that, under certain circumstances, a hard fork of a digital currency constitutes a taxable event giving rise to ordinary income, and it is clear from the reasoning of the Ruling &#38; FAQs that the IRS generally would treat an airdrop as a taxable event giving rise to ordinary income. Under the Ruling &#38; FAQs, a U.S. Holder will have a basis in any IR Virtual Currency received in a fork or airdrop equal to the amount of income the U.S. Holder recognizes as a result of such fork or airdrop and the U.S. Holder&#8217;s holding period for such IR Virtual Currency will begin as of the time it recognizes such income. U.S. Holders&#8217; pro rata shares of the expenses incurred by the Trust will be treated as &#8220;miscellaneous itemized deductions&#8221; for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, a non-corporate U.S. Holder&#8217;s share of these expenses will not be deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, a non-corporate U.S. Holder&#8217;s share of these expenses will be deductible for regular U.S. federal income tax purposes only to the extent that the U.S. Holder&#8217;s share of the expenses, when combined with other &#8220;miscellaneous itemized deductions,&#8221; exceeds 2% of the U.S. Holder&#8217;s adjusted gross income for the particular year, will not be deductible for U.S. federal alternative minimum tax purposes and will be subject to certain other limitations on deductibility. On a sale or other disposition of Shares, a U.S. Holder will be treated as having sold the Bitcoins underlying such Shares. Accordingly, the U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount realized on the sale of the Shares and (ii) the portion of the U.S. Holder&#8217;s tax basis in its pro rata share of the Bitcoins held in the Trust that is attributable to the Shares that were sold or otherwise subject to a disposition. Such tax basis generally will be determined by multiplying the tax basis of the U.S. Holder&#8217;s pro rata share of all of the Bitcoins held in the Trust immediately prior to such sale or other disposition by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of Shares disposed of and the denominator of which is the total number of Shares held by such U.S. Holder immediately prior to such sale or other disposition (such fraction, expressed as a percentage, the &#8220;Share Percentage&#8221;). If the U.S. Holder&#8217;s share of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins consists of separate lots with separate tax bases and\/or holding periods, the U.S. Holder will be treated as having sold the Share Percentage of each such lot. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a sale or other disposition of Shares will generally be short-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder&#8217;s holding period for the Bitcoins underlying such Shares is one year or less and long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder&#8217;s holding period for the Bitcoins underlying such Shares is more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations. After any sale or other disposition of fewer than all of a U.S. Holder&#8217;s Shares, the U.S. Holder&#8217;s tax basis in its pro rata share of the Bitcoins held in the Trust immediately after the disposition will equal the tax basis in its pro rata share of the total amount of the Bitcoins held in the Trust immediately prior to the disposition, less the portion of that tax basis that is taken into account in determining the amount of gain or loss recognized by the U.S. Holder on the disposition. Any brokerage or other transaction fee incurred by a U.S. Holder in purchasing Shares generally will be added to the U.S. Holder&#8217;s tax basis in the underlying assets of the Trust. Similarly, any brokerage fee or other transaction fee incurred by a U.S. Holder in selling Shares generally will reduce the amount realized by the U.S. Holder with respect to the sale. In the absence of guidance to the contrary, it is possible that any income recognized by a U.S. tax-exempt shareholder as a consequence of a hard fork, airdrop or similar occurrence would constitute UBTI. A tax-exempt shareholder should consult its tax advisor regarding whether such shareholder may recognize some UBTI as a consequence of an investment in Shares. &#160;Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders As used herein, the term &#8220;non-U.S. Holder&#8221; means a beneficial owner of a Share for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is not a U.S. Holder. The term &#8220;non-U.S. Holder&#8221; does not include (i) a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in a taxable year, (ii) a former U.S. citizen or U.S. resident or an entity that has expatriated from the United States&#59; (iii) a person whose income in respect of Shares is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States&#59; or (iv) an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Shareholders described in the preceding sentence should consult their tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning Shares. A non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax with respect to its share of any gain recognized on the Trust&#8217;s transfer of Bitcoins in payment of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee or any Additional Trust Expense or on the Trust&#8217;s sale or other disposition of Bitcoins. In addition, assuming that the Trust holds no asset other than Bitcoin, a non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax with respect to any gain it recognizes on a sale or other disposition of Shares. A non-U.S. Holder also will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax with respect to any distribution received from the Trust, whether in cash or in-kind. Provided that it does not constitute income that is treated as &#8220;effectively connected&#8221; with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, U.S.-source &#8220;fixed or determinable annual or periodical&#8221; (&#8220;FDAP&#8221;) income received, or treated as received, by a non-U.S. Holder will generally be subject to U.S. withholding tax at the rate of 30% (subject to possible reduction or elimination pursuant to an applicable tax treaty and to statutory exemptions such as the portfolio interest exemption). Although there is no guidance on point, it is likely that any ordinary income recognized by a non-U.S. Holder as a result of a fork, airdrop or similar occurrence would constitute FDAP income. It is unclear, however, whether any such FDAP income would be properly treated as U.S.-source or foreign-source FDAP income. Non-U.S. Holders should assume that, in the absence of guidance, a withholding agent (including the Sponsor) is likely to withhold 30% from a non-U.S. Holder&#8217;s pro rata share of any such income, including by deducting such withheld amounts from proceeds that such non-U.S. Holder would otherwise be entitled to receive in connection with a distribution of Incidental Rights, IR Virtual Currency or proceeds from the disposition of Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency. A non-U.S. Holder that is a resident of a country that maintains an income tax treaty with the United States may be eligible to claim the benefits of that treaty to reduce or eliminate, or to obtain a partial or full refund of, the 30% U.S. withholding tax on its share of any such income, but only if the non-U.S. Holder&#8217;s home country treats the Trust as &#8220;fiscally transparent,&#8221; as defined in applicable Treasury regulations. Although the nature of the Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency that the Trust may hold in the future is uncertain, it is unlikely that any such asset would give rise to income that is treated as &#8220;effectively connected&#8221; with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States or that any income derived by a non-U.S. Holder from any such asset would otherwise be subject to U.S. income or withholding tax, except as discussed above in connection with the fork, airdrop or similar occurrence giving rise to Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency. There can, however, be no complete assurance in this regard. In order to prevent the possible imposition of U.S. &#8220;backup&#8221; withholding and (if applicable) to qualify for a reduced rate of withholding tax at source under a treaty, a non-U.S. Holder must comply with certain certification requirements (generally, by delivering a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E to the relevant withholding agent). U.S. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding The Trust or the appropriate broker will file certain information returns with the IRS and provide shareholders with information regarding their annual income (if any) and expenses with respect to the Trust in accordance with applicable Treasury regulations. A U.S. Holder will generally be subject to information reporting requirements and backup withholding unless (i) the U.S. Holder is a corporation or other exempt recipient or (ii) in the case of backup withholding, the U.S. Holder provides a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding. In order to avoid the information reporting and backup withholding requirements, a non-U.S. Holder may have to comply with certification procedures to establish that it is not a U.S. person. The amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against the shareholder&#8217;s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS. FATCA As discussed above, it is unclear whether any ordinary income recognized by a non-U.S. Holder as a result of a fork, airdrop or similar occurrence would constitute U.S.-source FDAP income. Provisions of the Code commonly referred to as &#8220;FATCA&#8221; require withholding of 30% on payments of U.S.-source FDAP income and, subject to the discussion of proposed U.S. Treasury regulations below, of gross proceeds of dispositions of certain types of property that produce U.S.-source FDAP income to, &#8220;foreign financial institutions&#8221; (which is broadly defined for this purpose and in general includes investment vehicles) and certain other non-U.S. entities unless various U.S. information reporting and due diligence requirements (generally relating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests &#160;in or accounts with those entities) have been satisfied, or an exemption applies. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. In addition, regulations proposed by the U.S. Treasury Department (the preamble to which indicates that taxpayers may rely on the regulations pending their finalization) would eliminate the requirement under FATCA of withholding on gross proceeds. If FATCA withholding is imposed, a beneficial owner that is not a foreign financial institution generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld by filing a U.S. federal income tax return (which may entail significant administrative burden). Shareholders should consult their tax advisers regarding the effects of FATCA on an investment in the Trust . ERISA and Related ConsiderationsGeneral The following section sets forth certain consequences under ERISA and the Code which a fiduciary of an &#8220;employee benefit plan&#8221; as defined in and subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA, or of a &#8220;plan&#8221; as defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code, who has investment discretion should consider before deciding to acquire Shares with plan assets (such &#8220;employee benefit plans&#8221; and &#8220;plans&#8221; being referred to herein as &#8220;Plans,&#8221; and such fiduciaries with investment discretion being referred to herein as &#8220;Plan Fiduciaries&#8221;). The following summary is not intended to be complete, but only to address certain questions under ERISA and the Code that are likely to be raised by the Plan Fiduciary&#8217;s own counsel. * * * In general, the terms &#8220;employee benefit plan&#8221; as defined in ERISA and &#8220;plan&#8221; as defined in Section 4975 of the Code together refer to any plan or account of various types which provides retirement benefits or welfare benefits to an individual or to an employer&#8217;s employees and their beneficiaries. Such plans and accounts include, but are not limited to, corporate pension and profit sharing plans, &#8220;simplified employee pension plans,&#8221; Keogh plans for self-employed individuals (including partners), individual retirement accounts described in Section 408 of the Code and medical benefit plans. Each Plan Fiduciary must give appropriate consideration to the facts and circumstances that are relevant to an investment in the Trust, including the role an investment in the Trust plays in the Plan&#8217;s investment portfolio. Each Plan Fiduciary must be satisfied that investment in the Trust is a prudent investment for the Plan, that the investments of the Plan, including the investment in the Trust, are diversified so as to minimize the risks of large losses and that an investment in the Trust complies with the documents of the Plan and related trust and that an investment in the Trust does not give rise to a transaction prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. EACH PLAN FIDUCIARY CONSIDERING ACQUIRING SHARES MUST CONSULT ITS OWN LEGAL AND TAX ADVISERS BEFORE DOING SO. Restrictions on Investments by Benefit Plan Investors ERISA and a regulation issued thereunder contain rules for determining when an investment by a Plan in an entity will result in the underlying assets of the entity being deemed assets of the Plan for purposes of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code ( i.e. , &#8220;plan assets&#8221;). Those rules provide that assets of an entity will not be plan assets of a Plan that purchases an interest therein if the investment in the entity by all &#8220;benefit plan investors&#8221; is not &#8220;significant&#8221; or certain other exceptions apply. The term &#8220;benefit plan investors&#8221; includes all Plans ( i.e. , all &#8220;employee benefit plans&#8221; as defined in and subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA and all &#8220;plans&#8221; as defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code) and all entities that hold &#8220;plan assets&#8221; (each, a &#8220;Plan Assets Entity&#8221;) due to investments made in such entities by already described benefit plan investors. ERISA provides that a Plan Assets Entity is considered to hold plan assets only to the extent of the percentage of the Plan Assets Entity&#8217;s equity interests held by benefit plan investors. In addition, all or part of an investment made by an insurance company using assets from its general account may be treated as a benefit plan investor. Investments by benefit plan investors will be deemed not significant if benefit plan investors own, in the aggregate, less than 25% of the total value of each class of equity interests of the entity (determined by not including the investments of persons with discretionary authority or control over the assets of such entity, of any person who provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets, and &#8220;affiliates&#8221; (as defined in the regulations issued under ERISA) of such persons&#59; provided, however, that under no circumstances are investments by benefit plan investors excluded from such calculation). In order to avoid causing assets of the Trust to be &#8220;plan assets,&#8221; the Sponsor intends to restrict the aggregate investment by &#8220;benefit plan investors&#8221; to under 25% of the total value of the Shares of the Trust (not including the investments of the Trustee, the Sponsor, the distributor, any other person who provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to the assets of the Trust, any other person who has discretionary authority or control over the assets of the Trust, and any entity (other than a benefit plan investor) that is directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of such entities (including a partnership or other entity for which the Sponsor is the general partner, managing member, investment adviser or provides investment advice), and each of the principals, officers, and employees of any of the foregoing entities who has the &#160;power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of such entity or the Trust). Furthermore, because the 25% test is ongoing, it not only restricts additional investments by benefit plan investors, but also can cause the Sponsor to require that existing benefit plan investors redeem from the Trust in the event that other investors redeem their Shares. If rejection of subscriptions or such compulsory redemptions are necessary, as determined by the Sponsor, to avoid causing the assets of the Trust to be &#8220;plan assets,&#8221; the Sponsor will effect such rejections or redemptions in such manner as the Sponsor, in its sole discretion, determines. Ineligible Purchasers In general, Shares may not be purchased with the assets of a Plan if the Trustee, the Sponsor, the distributor, any placement agent, any of their respective affiliates or any of their respective employees either: (i) has investment discretion with respect to the investment of such Plan assets&#59; (ii) has authority or responsibility to give or regularly gives investment advice with respect to such Plan assets, for a fee, and pursuant to an agreement or understanding that such advice will serve as a primary basis for investment decisions with respect to such Plan assets and that such advice will be based on the particular investment needs of the Plan&#59; or (iii) is an employer maintaining or contributing to such Plan. A party that is described in clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence is a fiduciary under ERISA and the Code with respect to the Plan, and any such purchase might result in a &#8220;prohibited transaction&#8221; under ERISA and the Code. Except as otherwise set forth, the foregoing statements regarding the consequences under ERISA and the Code of an investment in the Trust are based on the provisions of the Code and ERISA as currently in effect, and the existing administrative and judicial interpretations thereunder. No assurance can be given that administrative, judicial or legislative changes will not occur that may make the foregoing statements incorrect or incomplete. ACCEPTANCE OF SUBSCRIPTIONS ON BEHALF OF PLANS IS IN NO RESPECT A REPRESENTATION BY THE SPONSOR OR ANY OTHER PARTY RELATED TO THE TRUST THAT THIS INVESTMENT MEETS THE RELEVANT LEGAL REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO INVESTMENTS BY ANY PARTICULAR PLAN OR THAT THIS INVESTMENT IS APPROPRIATE FOR ANY PARTICULAR PLAN. THE PERSON WITH INVESTMENT DISCRETION SHOULD CONSULT WITH HIS OR HER ATTORNEY AND FINANCIAL ADVISERS AS TO THE PROPRIETY OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE TRUST, IN LIGHT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTICULAR PLAN. ","5":" ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160; Overview of Our Business &#160; Planet Green is a Nevada company established in 1986 and is headquartered in Flushing, New York. We are a diversified technology and consumer products company with presence in North America and China in the follow businesses: Chemical Products, Tea Products and Online Advertising Services.&#160;Planet Green manages its operation in three business segments which include:&#160; &#160; &#9679; to grow, produce and distribute Cyan brick tea, black tea and green tea in China; and &#160; &#160; &#9679; to research, develop, manufacture and sell chemical products including formaldehyde, urea formaldehyde adhesive, methylal, ethanol fuel, fuel additives and clean fuel in China; and &#160;&#160; &#9679; to develop and operate a demand side platform which empowers buyers of advertising to manage and optimize their digital advertising across different real-time bidding networks in North America and China &#160; Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update &#160; Recently, there is an ongoing outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) first identified in China and has since spread rapidly globally. The pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of stores and business facilities globally for the past few months. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic. Given the rapidly expanding nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, and because substantially all of our business operations and our workforce are concentrated in China, our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and will continue to be adversely affected. Potential impact to our results of operations will also depend on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of the COVID-19 and the actions taken by government authorities and other entities to contain the COVID-19 or mitigate its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control. &#160; The impacts of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, and results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following: &#160; &#160; &#9679; We temporally closed our offices and production facilities to adhere to the policy from February 2020 until April 2020, as required by relevant PRC regulatory authorities. Our offices are slowly reopening pursuant to local guidelines. In the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused disruptions in our manufacturing operations, which have resulted in delays in the shipment of products to certain of our customers. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Some of our employees were in mandatory self-quarantine from January 2020 to April 2020. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Our customers have been negatively impacted by the outbreak, which may reduce the demand of our products. As a result, our revenue and income may be negatively impacted in 2020. &#160; &#160; &#9679; The situation may worsen if the COVID-19 pandemic continues. We continued to closely monitor our collections throughout 2020. &#160; A prolonged disruption or any further unforeseen delay in our operations of the manufacturing, delivery and assembly process within any of our production facilities could continue to result in delays in the shipment of products to our customers, increased costs and reduced revenue. &#160; We cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact. If the outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled, our business operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected as a result of the deteriorating market outlook, the slowdown in regional and national economic growth, weakened liquidity and financial condition of our customers or other factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties in the regions where we conduct business, cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot predict and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Now that we are closer to containment of the COVID-19 pandemic with the emergence of several very effective vaccines, market participants expect the economy will fully recover over the next year or two. &#160; &#160;&#160; Organizational Structure &#160; PLAG was incorporated on February 4, 1986 and was formerly known as &#8220;American Lorain Corporation.&#8221; Effective November 12, 2009, PLAG reincorporated in Nevada from Delaware. &#160; The following diagram illustrates our corporate structure as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, including our subsidiaries and our VIEs. &#160; &#160; &#160; Subsidiary &#160; We are a company that continuously strives to create new value and relentlessly to capture new opportunities, which is why we are growing and strengthening the internet-based business as another pillar towards the next growth stage. In addition to our Chinese domestic business, we set out for global market by acquiring 100% shares of Fast Approach in Canada on June 5, 2020 to embark on demand-side platform (DSP) business in North America.

In addition, we also research, develop, manufacture and sell products of formaldehyde, urea formaldehyde adhesive, methylal, ethanol fuel, fuel additives and clean fuel. &#160; Our ethanol fuel and fuel additives products business is carried on by our newly acquired VIE company, Jingshan Sanhe Luckysky. &#160; Our formaldehyde, urea formaldehyde adhesive, methylal, and clean fuel products business is carried out by our newly acquired VIE company, Jilin Chuangyuan. &#160; Service &#160; We provide a demand-side platform which allows buyers of digital advertising inventory to manage multiple advertisement exchange and data exchange through one interface.&#160; Our digital service is provided by our newly acquired company, Fast Approach. &#160; Our Manufacturing Facilities &#160; General &#160; We currently manufacture our products in Meihekou City, Jilin Province, Jingshan City and Xianning City, Hubei Province, China. &#160; The following table indicates the year that operations commenced at each of the facilities and the size of the facilities. &#160; Facility &#160; Year Operations Commenced &#160; &#160; Facility Size (square meters) &#160; Xianning Bozhuang * &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; &#160; 33,333 &#160; Jingshan Sanhe Luckysky ** &#160; &#160; 2018 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11,018 &#160; Jilin Chuangyuan*** &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; &#160; 59,690 &#160; &#160; &#160; * Became a VIE in May 2019. ** Became a VIE in January 2021 *** Became a VIE in March 2021. &#160; &#160;&#160; Production Lines &#160; We currently manufacture our different products using production lines operated through our subsidiaries. &#160; The production process for our cyan brick tea products involves, primary processing of fresh leaves, piling and fermenting, storing and aging, picking, pressing, and baking. The production process for our black tea products involves selecting and sorting the fresh leaves, withering, rolling, fermenting, baking and drying, grading according to color, prompting fragrance, packing and warehousing. The production process for our green tea products involves selecting and sorting the fresh leaves, airing, fixating, cooling, rolling, stir drying, selecting and grading, prompting fragrance, packing and warehousing. &#160; The production process for our formaldehyde products is illustrated as follows. The raw material methanol, after being injected into the high position tank, enters the methanol evaporator through the filter, mixes with the air from the roots blower to form the binary mixture, and then adds steam to form the ternary mixture, which is heated by the superheater to 120 &#8451; and enters the oxidizer, carries out oxidation and dehydrogenation reaction through the silver catalyst to form the formaldehyde gas, and then absorbs the formaldehyde solution through the first absorption tower and the second absorption tower. The excess waste gas is burned out by the exhaust gas boiler. &#160; The production process for our methyl starting with the raw materials methanol and formaldehyde are pumped into the reaction distillation tower according to the proportion. At the bottom of the tower, formaldehyde and methanol are indirectly heated by steam. The reaction liquid vapor from the tower upwards through the catalyst reaction to produce methyl acetal, and then through the distillation tower separation, cooling, the final product methyl acetal. &#160; The production process for our urea-formaldehyde glue is demonstrated as follows. Formaldehyde is pumped from the formaldehyde workshop into the tank of formaldehyde storage, and then pumped into the metering tank through the feed pump of formaldehyde. After the PH value is adjusted by adding alkali, it is sent into the reaction kettle. At the same time, urea is also added into the kettle according to the corresponding proportion, heating the reaction kettle. After heating up the kettle, melamine is added, so that the material can undergo addition reaction in the kettle. After the PH value is adjusted by dropping formic acid in the kettle, the material is sent into the condensation kettle through the transfer pump. Urea and additives are added into the condensation kettle according to a certain proportion for condensation reaction, and the finished product is formed after cooling treatment. &#160; The production process for our clean fuel oil is illustrated as follows. The self-control design of the facilities for storage of raw materials and addition of additives shall, in accordance with the requirements of the process, conduct centralized indication and adjustment of the temperature, flow rate and liquid level of the raw oil tanks, raw oil metering tanks, product oil allocation tanks and finished oil tanks during the fuel blending process; realize remote monitoring of the whole fuel production process, and conduct on-the-spot indication of pressure and partial flow rate. &#160; The production process for our construction rubber powder (re-dispersible latex powder) is demonstrated as follows. Using polymer emulsion (VAE emulsion) as raw material, all kinds of additives are added, and then transported to the reaction kettle through diaphragm pump to warm up and mix evenly, and then transported to the mixing kettle with additives through diaphragm pump to mix evenly, then transported to the high-speed reactor through diaphragm pump to emulsify, emulsified and then transported to the spare material tank through the diaphragm pump, and then transported to the spray drying tower through the spare material tank through the diaphragm pump to form polymer powder after spray drying, and the polymer powder and various additives are mixed and screened through the mixer to be packed into the warehouse. &#160; &#160;&#160; The following table shows the number and types of production lines, the types of products produced and the production capacity as of the date of this report: &#160; Facility &#160; Production Lines &#160; Product Portfolio &#160; Capacity Jingshan Sanhe Luckysky &#160; There are two production lines: the production line of ethanol fuel and the production line of fuel additive &#160; Alcohol based clean fuel, liquid wax, arene and biomass fuel &#160; Two production lines with a total production capacity of 300,000 tons\/ year for ethanol fuel, and 3000 tons\/year for fuel additive Xianning Bozhuang &#160; There are six production lines: the production line of cyan brick tea with traditional handicraft; the production line of cyan brick tea; the production line of teabag; the production line of green tea and the production line of black tea &#160; Cyan brick tea, black tea and green tea &#160; Production line with 5,020 tons of production capacity Jilin Chuangyuan &#160; The company has two formaldehyde production lines, eight rubber production units, one methylal production line and one clean fuel oil production line &#160; Formaldehyde, urea formaldehyde adhesive, methylal and clean fuel oil &#160; Annual production capacity of 120,000 tons of formaldehyde, 100,000 tons of urea formaldehyde glue, 3,0000 tons of methylal and 20,000 tons of clean fuel oil &#160; We operate our production lines year-round. &#160; Raw Materials &#160; Our Supply Sources &#160; Our business depends on obtaining a reliable supply of various products, including tea, refined methanol, methanol, formaldehyde and polymer emulsion.

(the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Utah on March 2, 2004. The Company is a media and entertainment company focused on creating, launching and marketing original pop music groups commonly referred to as &#8220;boy bands&#8221; and &#8220;girl groups.&#8221; The Company&#8217;s former operations were in the business of acquiring, training, and reselling horses with an emphasis in the purchase of thoroughbred weanlings or yearlings that were resold as juveniles.&#160;On October 26, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Asset Exchange&#8221;) with Crazy For The Boys, LLC (&#8220;CFTB&#8221;), a privately held company, and certain members owning membership interest in CFTB whereby the Company acquired certain assets from CFTB in exchange for 5,201,500 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The assets that were acquired included a movie screenplay, master recordings, trademarks, and web domain names (the &#8220;CFTB Assets&#8221;).&#160;On December 7, 2016, the Company organized a subsidiary in the state of Nevada, Crazy for the Boys Movie, LLC (&#8220;CFTB Movie&#8221;) which was created for the sole purpose of financing, producing and commercially exploiting (via all distribution sources and other means of revenue generation) one feature-length motion picture as a coming of age, musical dramedy, entitled &#8220;Crazy For The Boys&#8221; and all of its allied, ancillary, subsidiary and merchandising rights. The Company is the Managing Member of CFTB Movie and will have the sole and exclusive right to operate CFTB Movie.&#160;In May 2017, the Company entered into an Assignment and Transfer Agreement with Crazy for the Boys GA LLC (&#8220;CFTB GA&#8221;), a company organized in the state of Georgia, whereby CFTB GA assigned and transferred all ownership, asset rights and other interest in CFTB GA to CFTB Movie. CFTB GA was created for the sole purpose of producing the one feature-length motion picture entitled &#8220;Crazy For The Boys&#8221; in the State of Georgia, in the city of Savannah, which offers production incentives up to 30% of Georgia production expenditures in transferable tax credits. The Georgia tax incentive program is available for qualifying projects, including feature films, television series, commercials, music videos, animation and game development. Consequently, CFTB GA became a wholly owned subsidiary of CFTB Movie and as of December 31, 2018, the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of CFTB GA. Filming for the Movie was completed in July 2017 and the post-production phase was completed in December 2018. &#160; &#160; 4 &#160;All For One Media Corp. is in the business of targeting the lucrative tween demographic across a multitude of entertainment platforms. The Company&#8217;s primary business objective is to embark on creating, launching and marketing original pop music groups, commonly referred to as &#8220;boy bands&#8221; and &#8220;girl groups,&#8221; by utilizing both traditional and social media models. All For One Media owns over fifty completed professionally produced master recordings, as well as a full-length motion picture tentatively entitled Drama Drama (formerly with a working title of &#8220;Crazy For the Boys&#8221;) (the &#8220;Film&#8221;) that is ready for release. This musical comedy&#8217;s backstory creates a fictional girl group by the name of &#8220;Drama Drama&#8221;, and the Company intends to launch a new girl group with the same name simultaneous to the release of the Film.&#160;The Company expects to generate revenues from movie receipts, sales, downloads and streaming of original recorded music, videos, motion pictures, music publishing, live performances, licensed merchandise and corporate sponsorships.&#160;On January 17, 2020, our parent entity, entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement with, our subsidiary, Carmel Valley Productions Inc. whereby the Company sold 90% of its 100% interest in CVPI and any of the Company&#8217;s right to receive revenues or repayment from the $100,000 advance on film rights under the terms of the Co-Production and Finance Agreement dated on July 24, 2019, for a total purchase price of $50,000.&#160;On February 16, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Quiver Distribution RB USA, Inc (&#8220;Quiver&#8221;) to distribute (&#8220;Distribution Agreement&#8221;) our full-length PG13-rated feature film, Drama Drama, (formerly with a working title of &#8220;Crazy For the Boys&#8221;). Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, rights for all forms of VOD (including but not limited to transactional, subscription and advertising), EST, television, non-theatrical were given to Quiver and all other rights were reserved to the Company including ad-free youtube rights.

BUSINESS Overview Alimera Sciences, Inc., and its subsidiaries (we or Alimera), is a global pharmaceutical company whose mission is to be invaluable to patients, physicians and partners concerned with retinal health and maintaining better vision longer. ILUVIEN Our only commercial product is ILUVIEN &#174; , an intravitreal implant that treats patients by delivering a continuous microdose of the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide (FAc) in the eye, for up to 36 months. &#8220;Intravitreal&#8221; refers to the space inside the eye behind the lens that contains the jelly-like substance called vitreous. ILUVIEN was initially developed to treat diabetic macular edema (DME), a disease of the retina that affects individuals with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and can lead to severe vision loss and blindness. ILUVIEN is also used in certain countries in the EEA to prevent relapse in recurrent non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye (NIU-PS). Uveitis is an inflammatory disease of the uveal tract, which is comprised of the iris, ciliary body and choroid, that can lead to severe vision loss and blindness. ILUVIEN is inserted into the back of the patient&#8217;s eye in a non-surgical procedure employing a device with a 25-gauge needle, which allows for a self-sealing wound. We believe that corticosteroids provide the best option in the treatment of DME and NIU-PS because they reduce the inflammatory aspects of the disease. Further, we believe that ILUVIEN&#8217;s CONTINUOUS MICRODOSING&#8482; delivery makes it the only approved drug therapy for DME that can deliver consistent daily therapeutic levels of corticosteroid. The delivery mechanism of ILUVIEN provides lower daily and aggregate exposure to corticosteroids than any other intraocular dosage forms currently available, which we believe mitigates the typical risks associated with corticosteroid therapy. Further, the ILUVIEN implant, which is non-bioerodible, provides consistent delivery as a result of its constant surface area, permitting elution of FAc to the vitreous. This provides a sustained therapeutic effect on DME and NIU-PS. Other therapies that physicians currently use to treat DME, such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatments and other corticosteroids, are acute (short-acting) therapies that provide a higher initial daily dose but then rapidly decline, requiring frequent reinjection by the physician to maintain or reestablish the therapeutic effect. ILUVIEN delivers continuous daily sub-microgram levels of FAc in both in vitro and in vivo release kinetic studies for up to 36 months, making it the only single injection therapy available to treat the retina consistently every day for up to three years, allowing patients to see better, longer with fewer injections. Additionally, as demonstrated with real-world evidence, the side effects of ILUVIEN are consistent with and predictable following the use of shorter duration or acute corticosteroid therapies, increasing the physician&#8217;s ability to manage those side effects. The active compound in ILUVIEN is FAc, a non-proprietary corticosteroid that is a member of the class of steroids known as corticosteroids. Corticosteroids have demonstrated a range of pharmacological actions, including inhibition of inflammation, inhibition of leukostasis, up regulation of occludin, inhibition of the release of certain inflammatory cytokines and suppression of VEGF secretion. Leukostasis refers to the accumulation of white blood cells at a particular site, which leads to further tissue damage. Occludin is an important protein in maintaining and reinforcing the tight junctions between cells. These pharmacological actions have the potential to treat various ocular conditions, including DME, NIU-PS, Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and wet AMD. However, FAc shares many of the same &#8220;class effect&#8221; side effects seen with other corticosteroids that are currently available for intraocular use. The two main side effects of using corticosteroids to treat ocular conditions are (a) increased intraocular pressure, which may increase the risk of glaucoma, and (b) the acceleration of cataract formation. FAc is uniquely lipophilic, making it very effective at penetrating retina tissue, and allowing it to achieve a therapeutic effect at a very low dose, typically lower than other corticosteroids. Where We Market ILUVIEN to Treat Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) ILUVIEN has received marketing authorization for the use of ILUVIEN to treat DME for the indications and in the countries shown in the following table: Indication for the Treatment of DME Countries Where ILUVIEN Has Received Marketing Authorization to Treat DME Countries Where ILUVIEN Is Reimbursed to Treat DME Countries Where ILUVIEN is Currently Marketed to Treat DME Treatment of DME in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure U.S., Australia, Canada, Kuwait, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates U.S., Kuwait, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates U.S., Kuwait, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates Treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic DME considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies The United Kingdom (U.K.), Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Luxembourg The U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and the Netherlands The U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Austria and the Netherlands Where We Market ILUVIEN to Treat Recurrent Non-Infectious Uveitis Affecting the Posterior Segment of the Eye (NIU-PS) In December 2017, we filed in the 17 EEA countries in Europe where ILUVIEN is currently approved for the treatment of DME an application for a new indication for ILUVIEN for the prevention of relapse in recurrent NIU-PS. In March 2019, we announced that the U.K.&#8217;s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), in its Final Appraisal Determination for national reimbursement, had recommended funding for ILUVIEN 190 micrograms intravitreal implant in applicator for the prevention of relapse in recurrent NIU-PS. In addition, ILUVIEN has received marketing authorization in 16 European countries and reimbursement in four countries, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and the U.K., for the prevention of relapse in recurrent NIU-PS. Indication for the Treatment of NIU-PS Countries Where ILUVIEN Has Received Marketing Authorization to Treat NIU-PS Countries Where ILUVIEN Is Reimbursed to Treat NIU-PS Countries Where ILUVIEN is Currently Marketed to Treat NIU-PS The prevention of relapse in recurrent NIU-PS The U.K., Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Luxembourg The U.K., Germany, Spain and the Netherlands The U.K., Germany and the Netherlands We launched ILUVIEN for the NIU-PS indication in Germany and the U.K. during the third quarter of 2019 and the Netherlands during the fourth quarter of 2020. In January 2022, we obtained reimbursement for the NIU-PS indication in Spain, and we are currently launching the indication. Where We Sell Direct We commercially market ILUVIEN directly in the U.S., Germany, the U.K., Portugal, Ireland and the four countries of the Nordic Region (Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden). In the Nordic Region we operate with the support of an exclusive wholesaler to support tendering processes in hospitals. Where We Sell Through Distributors We have entered into various agreements under which distributors are providing or will provide regulatory, reimbursement or sales and marketing support for ILUVIEN in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, China and several countries in the Western Pacific and several countries in the Middle East. We have an extended distribution relationship with our French distributor Horus Pharma to distribute ILUVIEN in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. As of December 31, 2021, we have recognized revenue from sales of ILUVIEN to our international distributors in the Middle East, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain and the Netherlands. Business Strategy We presently focus on diseases affecting the back of the eye, or retina, because we believe these diseases are not sufficiently treated with current therapies and treatment regimens and represent a significant market opportunity. Our strategy is to establish ILUVIEN as a leading therapy for DME and NIU-PS patients for which ILUVIEN is proven safe and effective because of its ability to help patients see better, longer with fewer injections for up to three years. We rely on our management&#8217;s experience and the breadth of our commercial resources in both the U.S. and Europe to maintain focus on the retinal space to commercialize ILUVIEN. We intend to use those same strengths to acquire, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize other potential eye care products. To implement our strategy , and taking into account the effects and potential future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we intend to: &#61623; Maximize the commercial success of ILUVIEN for treatment of DME in the U.S. and Europe where we have obtained regulatory approval. We are seeking to increase our direct sales and sales to distributors in the U.S. and Europe where we have obtained regulatory approval and are currently marketing ILUVIEN. We are also pursuing opportunities to sell ILUVIEN in the remaining countries where we have obtained regulatory approval but are not currently marketing ILUVIEN. &#61623; Pursue commercialization of ILUVIEN for treatment of DME in additional countries outside the U.S. and Europe where we have obtained regulatory approval . We have established distribution relationships in Australia, New Zealand and the Middle East. Our distributor in the Middle East began selling ILUVIEN in 2016 and launched commercial sales in 2019. In 2021, we entered into a license agreement with a distributor in China that plans to pursue regulatory approval and commercialization in China and the Western Pacific. &#61623; Pursue commercialization of ILUVIEN for NIU-PS in Europe where we have obtained regulatory approval. We are seeking to increase our direct sales in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the U.K. where we have obtained regulatory approval and are currently marketing ILUVIEN for NIU-PS. We are pursuing opportunities to sell ILUVIEN for NIU-PS in nine additional European countries, where we have obtained regulatory approval and are currently seeking reimbursement. &#61623; Pursue approval for ILUVIEN for DME and NIU-PS in additional countries. We will evaluate seeking regulatory approval for the treatment of DME in countries where we do not have approval and of NIU-PS in the remainder of Europe and in the Middle East and Africa where we own the rights to market ILUVIEN. &#61623; Expand our ophthalmic product offerings. We believe there are further unmet medical needs in the treatment of retinal diseases. We intend to continue to evaluate in-licensing and acquisition opportunities for compounds and technologies with potential treatment applications for diseases affecting the eye. Disease Overview and Market Opportunity Diabetes and Diabetic Retinopathy Diabetes mellitus, with its systemic and ophthalmic complications, represents a global public health threat. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated prevalence of diabetes worldwide in 2021 increased to 537 million people and is expected to increase to 783 million people by 2045. The 2020 National Diabetes Statistics Reports published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that as of 2019, 37.3 million Americans, or 11.3% of the U.S. population, had diabetes and that there were 1.4 million new cases of diabetes diagnosed among people ages 18 and older. Approximately 1 in 4 adults living with diabetes, 8.5 million Americans, did not know they had the condition and are therefore not being monitored and treated to control their disease and prevent systemic and ophthalmic complications. The report also identified that around 96.0 million people have prediabetes, a condition that if not treated often leads to type 2 diabetes within five years. In this population, only 19.0% of adults know they had prediabetes. In the International Diabetes Federation 10 th Edition IDF Diabetes Atlas, it is estimated that there are approximately 61.0 million people in Europe in 2021 with diabetes and that 22.0 million remain undiagnosed. In the Middle East, it is estimated there are approximately 22.4 million people with diabetes and 17.5 million remain undiagnosed. All patients with diabetes are at risk of developing some form of diabetic retinopathy, an ophthalmic complication of diabetes with symptoms including the swelling and leakage of blood vessels within the retina or the abnormal growth of new blood vessels on the surface of the retina. According to the CDC Vision Health Initiative, diabetic retinopathy causes approximately 12,000 to 24,000 new cases of blindness in the U.S. each year; making diabetes the leading cause of new cases of blindness in adults aged 20 to 70. Diabetic retinopathy can be divided into either non-proliferative or proliferative retinopathy. Non-proliferative retinopathy develops first and causes increased capillary permeability, micro aneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates (when fluid leaks into spaces between vessels), macular ischemia (lack of oxygen) and macular edema (thickening of the retina caused by fluid leakage from capillaries). Proliferative retinopathy is an advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy that, in addition to characteristics of non-proliferative retinopathy, results in the growth of new blood vessels. These new blood vessels are abnormal and fragile, growing along the retina and along the surface of the clear vitreous gel that fills the inside of the eye. By themselves, these blood vessels do not cause symptoms or vision loss. However, these blood vessels have thin, fragile walls that are prone to leakage and hemorrhage. Diabetic Macular Edema When the blood vessel leakage of diabetic retinopathy leads to the build-up of fluid, or edema, in a region of the retina called the macula, the condition is called diabetic macular edema (DME). This area of the eye is important for the sharp, straight-ahead vision that is used for reading, recognizing faces, and driving. There are an estimated 750,000 people with DME in the U.S., according to the National Eye Institute&#8217;s 2019 update. DME is the most common cause of vision loss among people with diabetic retinopathy and about 30% of people with diabetic retinopathy will develop DME. It is more likely to occur as diabetic retinopathy worsens, although it may occur at any stage of the disease. The onset of DME is painless and may go undetected by the patient until it manifests with the blurring of central vision or acute vision loss. The severity of this blurring may range from mild to profound loss of vision. Studies have shown that DME is a multifactorial disease underpinned by inflammatory cytokine activity in the eye. Of the currently approved pharmacotherapies used to treat DME, only corticosteroids, including FAc found in the ILUVIEN implant, affect these cytokines. As the incidence of diabetes continues to increase worldwide, the incidence of DME and other complications is predicted to rise as well. Most patients who suffer from diabetes do not meet glycemic (glucose or blood sugar) targets, resulting in hyperglycemia (elevated levels of glucose in the blood). This, in turn, leads to the development of micro-vascular complications, which manifest in the eye as diabetic retinopathy, as well as elevated cytokines that break down the blood-retina barrier, leading to macular edema (DME) in many diabetic retinopathy patients. Uveitis Uveitis means inflammation of the uveal tract, which is a layer of tissue located between the outer layer (cornea and sclera) and the inner layer (the retina) of the eye. The front portion (anterior) of the uveal tract contains the iris, and the back portion (posterior) of the uveal tract contains the choroid and the stroma of the ciliary body. Inflammation of the uvea encompasses approximately 30 inflammatory disorders characterized by intraocular inflammation, a major cause of visual loss in people of working age in both developed and developing countries. It can affect people of all ages, producing swelling and destroying eye tissues, which can lead to severe vision loss and blindness. According to the classification scheme recommended by the International Uveitis Study Group, the disease can be classified on the basis of anatomic locations: anterior, intermediate, posterior or pan uveitis. Uveitis can be caused by a number of factors such as infection (infectious uveitis) or other autoimmune diseases or conditions. Non-infectious uveitis is a persistent and recurrent disease that can adversely affect the retina. Additionally, it commonly affects vision, more so than anterior uveitis, and macular edema is the most common mechanism of visual loss, affecting 44% patients with posterior uveitis. There are two forms of uveitis: &#61623; infectious uveitis (bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic), which is treated with an appropriate antimicrobial drug as well as corticosteroids and cycloplegics; and &#61623; non-infectious uveitis (NIU), where corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation and prevent adhesions in the eye. Current Treatments for DME Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapies are the current standard of care for the treatment of DME. Lucentis (ranibizumab) and Eylea (aflibercept) are approved in the U.S. and are the only approved anti-VEGF therapies marketed for the treatment of vision loss associated with DME in Europe. Genentech&#8217;s Vybismo (faricimab), another anti-VEGF therapy, was approved in January 2022 for the treatment of vision loss associated with DME in the U.S. Novartis is pursing approval for Beovu &#174; (brolucizumab-dbll) to treat DME in the U.S. Off-label injections of the anti-VEGF therapy Avastin (bevacizumab) are also used to treat DME. However, anti-VEGF therapies are acute therapies and require multiple and frequent injections to achieve the same therapeutic effect reported in randomized controlled trials. Further, DME is a multi-factorial disease, and anti-VEGF therapy does not address all of these factors. As a result, many patients do not achieve a sufficient response, either because of the limited therapeutic effect or the inability or unwillingness of patients to routinely attend clinic appointments, meaning that anti-VEGF therapy is not optimally administered. When not optimally administered, these acute therapies allow for a recurrence of the edema. In addition, these therapies have safety profiles that include an increased risk of endophthalmitis, a serious eye infection that must be treated with high doses of antibiotics. This risk of endophthalmitis is associated with any intravitreal injection. There is evidence that intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy affects systemic VEGF levels, which may have cardiovascular complications. Intravitreal corticosteroid therapies are also used to treat DME. Acute corticosteroids typically have peak effects within two to three months, and there is a need for repeated injections. Similarly, without optimized treatment frequency, macular edema is allowed to recur when the effect of acute corticosteroids dissipates. Ozurdex (dexamethasone), a short-acting corticosteroid, is marketed for the treatment of vision loss associated with DME in Europe and for the treatment of DME in the U.S. Triamcinolone acetonide, another short-acting steroid, is commonly used off-label to treat DME. In contrast to the dexamethasone implant and triamcinolone acetonide, which are both acute therapies, ILUVIEN is a long-term persistent and continuous steroid delivery therapy. The steroid in the ILUVIEN implant, fluocinolone acetonide, or FAc, is a key lipophilic component that allows a single implant to deliver a sustained daily dose for up to 36 months. Corticosteroids have historically been associated with significant increases in intraocular pressure, which may increase the risk of glaucoma. Additionally, corticosteroids are associated with the acceleration of cataract formation. We believe the low dose of ILUVIEN mitigates these side effects and makes them more manageable. Additionally, the side effects of ILUVIEN are consistent with and predictable following the use of shorter duration or acute corticosteroid therapies, increasing the physician&#8217;s ability to manage those side effects. Laser photocoagulation is a retinal procedure in which a laser is used to apply a burn, or a pattern of burns, to cauterize leaky blood vessels to reduce edema. Visual acuity gains are less frequently seen with this therapy, as it is used to prevent or slow the loss of vision. Further, this destructive procedure has undesirable side effects including partial loss of peripheral and night vision. Current Treatments for NIU-PS Historically, the treatment of uveitis varies according to the type and location of uveitis. The inflammation in non-infectious uveitis (NIU) can be anterior (at the front of the eye) or posterior (at the back of the eye) or in both locations. Importantly though, all forms of NIU can affect the posterior segment of the eye. In anterior forms of NIU, drops are used to address inflammation; however, in patients where the posterior segment is affected, these drops do not penetrate the eye to address the posterior segment. Other agents, both intravitreal and systemic, are specifically licensed for the treatment of active non-infectious posterior uveitis. This means that treatment of NIU-PS focuses on (a) systemic therapy, administered in a tablet form or via injection, which very often leads to side effects that adversely affect the whole body, or (b) the localized delivery of therapies, usually a steroid. Patients with NIU-PS are initially treated with systemic steroids, which are very effective, but when used at high doses for extended periods can lead to serious side effects. These side effects include acne, weight gain, sleep and mood disorders, hypertension and osteoporosis, which can limit the sustained use of systemic steroids. Patients then often progress to steroid-sparing therapies with systemic immune suppressants or biologics, which themselves can have severe side effects, including an increased risk of cancer and infections. In addition, periocular or intraocular steroids may be used to try to locally control inflammation in NIU-PS. Other therapies that may be used to treat NIU-PS include immunosuppressive drugs and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. A significant problem for patients and clinicians is that recurrence of NIU-PS is very common. In chronic NIU-PS, recurrence often occurs within six months of withholding treatment, and patients and clinicians are forced to go through cycles of treatment initiation and cessation with the accompanying complexity of managing several drug classes, and their side effects, at once. For the patient, this approach to treatment provides temporary relief, but with uncertainty of when the next relapse of their disease will occur. Recurrence is known to put the patient&#8217;s vision at risk, so there is a need for treatments that can provide longer term control of inflammation in this setting. For patients with recurrent NIU-PS, locally delivered (intravitreal) steroids present an attractive treatment strategy allowing for effective delivery of steroid therapy at the point of need, while minimizing the risk of systemic side effects. For intravitreal treatment, the short-acting Ozurdex implant is marketed in Europe for the treatment of adult patients with active inflammation of the posterior segment of the eye presenting as non-infectious uveitis and for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis. In contrast clinical trials have demonstrated that ILUVIEN significantly extends the time to relapse in patients with recurrent NIU-PS, while at the same time reducing the need for adjunctive treatments, including systemic drug treatment. Our NEW DAY Study We believe that ILUVIEN continues to be underutilized in the treatment of DME and should be used much earlier in patients suffering from DME. Our prior clinical data sets demonstrate the ability of ILUVIEN to control the underlying disease process and reduce the recurrence of edema for up to three years, rather than treating recurrent chronic edema with short-term therapies. With the NEW DAY Study, we intend to demonstrate the efficacy of ILUVIEN as baseline therapy in patients with early DME by comparing ILUVIEN to the current standard of care, anti-VEGF therapy. On July 9, 2020, we announced the initiation of our NEW DAY clinical trial, a multicenter, single masked, randomized and controlled trial designed to generate prospective data evaluating ILUVIEN as a baseline therapy in the treatment of DME and demonstrate its advantages over using the current standard of care of repeat anti-VEGF injections. The NEW DAY Study is planned to enroll approximately 300 treatment-na&#239;ve, or almost na&#239;ve, DME patients in approximately 42 sites around the U.S. As of February 28, 2022, we have enrolled 117 DME patients. We expect the pace of the enrollment to increase as the COVID-19 pandemic begins to resolve. Patients who meet the entry criteria will be randomized to receive either an ILUVIEN intravitreal implant or five injections of intravitreal aflibercept 2 mg at four-week intervals for the first 16 weeks as a loading dose. After the initial 16-week period, both arms will be evaluated every four weeks and receive supplemental intravitreal injections of aflibercept 2 mg only as needed. Criteria for supplemental treatment is set by protocol and will be identical in both treatment arms. The planned treatment period in the study is 18 months. Once the treatment period is concluded, patients will be given the option to participate in an open label extension study for up to 42 months. The primary outcome measure for NEW DAY is the mean number of supplemental aflibercept injections needed during the trial between treatment groups. Key secondary endpoints include mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score over time up to 18 months, time to first supplemental treatment, retinal thickness amplitude on optical coherence tomography (OCT), and diabetic retinopathy scores. In addition, the study will collect patient-reported outcome measures to evaluate the effect on patients&#8217; quality of life and level of functioning. Exploratory endpoints will include neuronal functional measures and OCT imaging measures of retinal nerve layer thickness. ILUVIEN for Other Diseases of the Eye Although we are not actively conducting clinical trials for a new indication, we believe that ILUVIEN has the potential to address other ophthalmic diseases such as RVO, NPDR, dry AMD and wet AMD. ILUVIEN Commercialization Status Diabetic Macular Edema ILUVIEN has received marketing authorization for two indications in various countries as noted above in &#8220;Overview - Where We Market ILUVIEN to Treat Diabetic Macular Edema (DME).&#8221; We plan to pursue regulatory approval for ILUVIEN for the treatment of DME, directly or with a partner, in additional countries. Uveitis ILUVIEN has received marketing authorization for treatment of NIU-PS in the U.K., 15 countries of the EEA, and in the United Arab Emirates. We plan to pursue our right to seek approval in other countries of the Middle East and Africa. We do not have the contractual right to pursue approval to treat NIU-PS in the U.S., and therefore do not have marketing authorization in the U.S. We have obtained marketing authorization for ILUVIEN to treat NIU-PS in various countries as noted above in &#8220;Overview - Where We Market ILUVIEN to Treat Recurrent Non-Infectious Uveitis Affecting the Posterior Segment of the Eye (NIU-PS).&#8221; We will evaluate seeking approval for the treatment of NIU-PS in other countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa where we have the license to use ILUVIEN. Sales and Marketing Our sales personnel focus on physician offices, clinics, pharmacies and hospitals in the U.S. and in European countries where we seek to persuade end users to purchase ILUVIEN. In our promotional efforts, we focus on three main areas to generate demand for ILUVIEN. The first is to gain access for ILUVIEN on formularies, contracts and through national and local health care authorities to achieve a reasonable price in the countries in which we intend to commercialize. Second is to educate physicians on the efficacy and safety of our products through direct promotion, advocacy building and indirect marketing activities. Third is to enable patients and caregivers in markets where it is permitted to become more educated on their disease and the possible treatments. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected our sales and marketing efforts in a number of ways, which has in turn had an adverse impact on our revenues. Governments and private parties have imposed limitations on in-person access to physicians. During the periods in which those limitations were in effect, they made it difficult or impossible for our sales representatives (including those employed by our distributors) to meet with retina specialists and their staff to educate them about the benefits of ILUVIEN and to provide support for insurance pre-certifications. Those limitations also affected patient access to treatment, given that ILUVIEN is administered only by an injection into the eye, which means telemedicine is not a viable substitute. Our business has also been negatively affected by patient behavior in the current environment. Most of our ILUVIEN sales are driven by the use of ILUVIEN to treat diabetic macular edema, or DME. Given that governmental authorities have cited diabetes as a factor that places a person at higher risk for severe illness from the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant percentage of those patients are or may have been unwilling to visit their physicians in person (even if otherwise permitted) for fear of contracting the COVID-19 coronavirus. Distributor Agreements We have various agreements under which distributors are providing or will provide regulatory, reimbursement or sales and marketing support for commercialization of ILUVIEN in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand, China and other countries of the Western Pacific and in the Middle East. Pursuant to these agreements, our distributors assisted or will assist us in obtaining and maintaining approval and reimbursement approval, or they will seek approval or reimbursement approval with our oversight in those countries, if such approval or reimbursement approval has not already been obtained. For more information about our April 2021 license agreement with Ocumension Therapeutics for China and the Western Pacific, see Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Overview &#8211; Transactions with Ocumension Therapeutics.&#8221; Manufacturing We do not have an in-house manufacturing capability for our products and depend and expect to continue to depend exclusively on third-party contract manufacturers to produce and package ILUVIEN. We manage the quality of our product produced by these manufacturers through quality agreements and our quality system to ensure that they produce active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and finished drug products in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain agreements with potential and existing manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to ILUVIEN. The manufacturing process for ILUVIEN consists of filling a polyimide tube with a paste consisting of 190 micrograms of FAc in an aqueous slurry of polyvinyl alcohol, cutting the tube into smaller sections in the proper lengths for the ILUVIEN implant, capping each small section with a permeable membrane cap on one end and an impermeable silicone cap on the other end to create the ILUVIEN implant, curing the implant at high temperature, loading the implant inside the ILUVIEN applicator, and packaging and sterilizing the product. This process has been validated at Alliance Medical Products Inc., a Siegfried Company (Alliance). We have agreements with a single third-party manufacturer for each of the following: &#61623; the manufacture of FAc, ILUVIEN&#8217;s active pharmaceutical ingredient (FARMABIOS SpA\/Byron Chemical Company Inc.); &#61623; the manufacture of the components of the ILUVIEN applicator (Cadence, Inc. (Cadence)); &#61623; the manufacture of the ILUVIEN implant, final assembly of the injector with the implant and release testing in the U.S. (Alliance); &#61623; the quality release testing of ILUVIEN (Alliance); &#61623; final product release to market in the European Economic Area (EEA) post-Brexit (carried out in Ireland by Packaging Coordinators, Inc.); and &#61623; final product release to market in the U.K., post-Brexit (AndersonBrecon Limited trading as Packaging Coordinators, Inc.). Although we may seek alternative providers in the future, we do not currently have alternate providers for any of these tasks. We recently replaced FlexMedical, an affiliate of Flextronics International, Ltd. (Flextronics), with Cadence as described below. Under our agreement with Alliance, which we entered into in 2010 and amended and restated in 2016, we are responsible for supplying Alliance with the ILUVIEN applicator and the API. We purchased certain equipment at Alliance&#8217;s facility that Alliance uses solely to manufacture and package ILUVIEN for us. We have agreed to order from Alliance at least 80% of our total requirements for new units of ILUVIEN in the U.S., Canada and Europe in a calendar year, provided that Alliance is able to fulfill our supply requirements and is not in breach of its agreements or obligations to us. Currently, we order 100% of our global requirements for ILUVIEN units from Alliance because we do not have an alternate supplier. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its provisions, the amended and restated agreement has a remaining term through February 2023 and will automatically renew for successive terms of one year unless either party delivers written notice of non-renewal to the other at least 12 months before the end of the then current term. As of the date of this filing, we have not received a notice of non-renewal. On October 30, 2020, we entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement with Cadence, Inc., to manufacture the components used in the ILUVIEN applicator. Cadence has completed the final stages of process qualification and has been manufacturing production components since the second quarter of 2021. We received European and FDA approval of the change during 2021. Business Segments During the first quarter of 2021, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), who is the chief operating decision maker (CODM), changed the manner in which the CODM monitors performance, aligns strategies and allocates resources, which resulted in a change in the operating segments. Our operations are now managed as three operating segments: U.S., International and Operating Cost. We determined that each of these operating segments represented a reportable segment. Previously, we were managed as two operating segments: U.S. and International. Financial information about our business segments is included below in (a) Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Segment Review&#8221; and (b) Note 19 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Customers Our revenues for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were generated from product sales primarily in the U.S., Germany, France and the U.K. and for 2021, the upfront license payment under the Ocumension License Agreement, which resulted in license revenue of approximately $11.0 million. In the U.S., two large pharmaceutical distributors accounted for 55% and 49% of our consolidated product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These distributors maintain inventories of ILUVIEN and sell to physician offices, pharmacies and hospitals. Internationally, in countries where we sell direct, our customers are hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. We sometimes refer to physician offices, pharmacies, hospitals and clinics as end users. In international countries where we sell to distributors, these distributors maintain inventory levels of ILUVIEN and sell to their customers. Competition The development and commercialization of new drugs and drug delivery technologies is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to ILUVIEN and any products or product candidates we may develop or commercialize in the future from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide, many of whom have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In the countries in which ILUVIEN has received or been recommended for marketing authorization or becomes approved for use in the treatment of DME, it competes or will compete against the use of anti-VEGF therapies, short duration corticosteroids and laser photocoagulation or other therapies that may be approved in the future. Other companies are working to develop other drug therapies and sustained delivery platforms for DME and other indications. These competitive therapies may result in pricing pressure even if ILUVIEN is otherwise viewed as a preferable therapy. We believe that the following drugs and treatments compete with ILUVIEN: &#61623; Lucentis &#169; (ranibizumab injection), marketed by Genentech (Roche) in the U.S. and Novartis in the rest of the world, and Avastin (bevacizumab), an oncology product marketed by the Roche group, are both antibodies that inhibit VEGF signaling pathways. Lucentis is currently approved for the treatment of DME, the treatment of diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME, the treatment of neovascular wet AMD and the treatment of macular edema following RVO in the U.S. In the EEA, the indications are similar except for diabetic retinopathy where the indication is for the treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. &#61623; Avastin &#169; (bevacizumab), is used by retinal specialists in both the U.S. and in certain countries of the EEA in the treatment of numerous retinal diseases off label but is not formulated or approved for any ophthalmic use. &#61623; Eylea &#169; (aflibercept), marketed by Regeneron in the U.S. and by Bayer in the EEA, is a VEGF antagonist that is approved for the treatment of DME, diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME, neovascular wet AMD and RVO in the U.S. In the EEA, the indication does not include diabetic retinopathy. &#61623; Beovu &#174; (brolucizumab-dbll), marketed by Novartis, is a VEGF inhibitor indicated for the treatment of neovascular wet AMD. Beovu has been approved for the treatment of wet AMD in the U.S. and in all 27 European Union member states as well as the U.K., Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. Novartis has completed trials for the treatment of DME and indicated publicly that they are seeking FDA approval for that indication. &#61623; Vabysmo &#174; (faricimab), marketed by Genentech, is a VEGF inhibitor and Ang-2 inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with Neovascular Wet AMD and DME. Vabysmo was approved in January 2022 for the treatment of DME in the U.S. The European Medicines Agency has also validated the faricimab Marketing Authorization Application submission in Wet AMD and DME. &#61623; Ozurdex &#169; (dexamethasone intravitreal implant), marketed by Allergan (now owned by AbbVie), is a short duration biodegradable implant that delivers the corticosteroid dexamethasone. Ozurdex is approved for the treatment of DME, macular edema following branch or central RVO and non-infectious uveitis in the U.S. In the EEA, the indication for DME is for visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema in persons who are pseudophakic (persons who have had an artificial lens implanted after the natural eye lens has been removed) or who are considered insufficiently responsive to, or unsuitable for, non-corticosteroid therapy. It is also indicated for macular edema following either Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) or Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) and inflammation of the posterior segment of the eye presenting as non-infectious uveitis. &#61623; Humira &#169; (adalimumab), marketed by Abbvie, is a TNF-blocker that has an ophthalmic indication. It works by targeting and blocking a specific source of inflammation that plays a role in non-infectious uveitis. In the U.S., Humira is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and pan uveitis. In the EEA, Humira is indicated for the treatment of chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in children aged two years or older who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy. &#61623; Intravitreal triamcinolone is used by some physicians for the treatment of DME although it is not approved for DME. &#61623; Laser photocoagulation is currently used to treat DME and may be used in conjunction with drug therapies as well. Other laser or surgical treatments for DME may also compete against ILUVIEN. In addition, a number of other companies are developing drug therapies or delivery platforms for the treatment of retinal diseases. We believe we will be less likely to face a generic competitor for ILUVIEN for the treatment of DME because of the bioequivalency requirements of a generic form of ILUVIEN. A generic pharmaceutical competitor to ILUVIEN would need to establish bioequivalency through the demonstration of an equivalent pharmacodynamic endpoint in a clinical trial. We believe conducting such a clinical trial would be cost-prohibitive and time-consuming, although we cannot provide any assurances in that regard. The licensing and acquisition of pharmaceutical products, which is part of our strategy, is a highly competitive area. A number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire products. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to, among other factors, their size, cash flow and institutional experience. The active pharmaceutical ingredient in ILUVIEN is FAc, which is not patent protected. As a result, our competitors could develop an alternative formulation or delivery mechanisms to treat diseases of the eye with FAc. For a description of our license of proprietary insert technology for ILUVIEN, see the section immediately below. The COVID-19 Pandemic and Our Steps to Address its Effects on Our Business The unprecedented events of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its unpredictable duration, in the regions where we have customers, employees and distributors have had an adverse effect on our sales of ILUVIEN and thus on our net revenues and may in the future have an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. These adverse effects of the pandemic on us have resulted from the following, among other factors : &#8226; Limitations imposed by governments and private parties on in-person access to physicians have adversely affected us in certain countries where ILUVIEN is currently marketed and may again do so if reimposed where they have been lifted. &#8226; Patients&#8217; concerns about their personal health during the COVID-19 pandemic have also negatively affected our business. Many DME patients have been hesitant or even unwilling to visit their physicians in person (even if otherwise permitted) for fear of contracting the COVID-19 coronavirus. &#8226; Limitations on travel have curtailed our in-person marketing activities and may again do so if reimposed. &#8226; As physicians gain increased access to patients as a result of the lifting of limitations in the U.K and in Europe, they may give a higher priority to patients with acute illnesses before treating patients with chronic illnesses such as DME, thereby reducing or delaying the number of ILUVIEN treatments that might otherwise have been performed. &#8226; SARS-CoV-2 variants such as Delta and Omicron have emerged and may again emerge, with unpredictable effects on our business. These limitations and other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had an adverse impact on our revenues beginning late in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing to the date of this report to some degree. These factors may continue to adversely impact our revenue and capital resources, although the extent and duration of that impact is currently uncertain. (Please refer to &#8220;Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Projections&#8221; above.) In response to these developments, we have implemented measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our financial position and operations. These measures include the following: &#8226; We are continuing to monitor the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 variants and to increase our engagement with our customers to mitigate any anticipated loss of revenue in those markets that may be affected. &#8226; We are investing in e-marketing and in enhancing our capabilities to conduct meetings virtually as well as in person. For more information about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the related risks we face, p lease see Part I, Item 1A , &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Related to the P ublic Health Pandemic,&#8221; and Part II, Item 7, &#8220; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic.&#8221; Licenses and Agreements EyePoint Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. In 2005, we entered into an agreement with EyePoint Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (EyePoint), formerly known as pSivida US, Inc., for the use of FAc in EyePoint&#8217;s proprietary insert technology. In July 2017, we amended and restated the EyePoint agreement in the Second Amended and Restated Collaboration Agreement (New Collaboration Agreement). The New Collaboration Agreement provides us with a license to utilize certain underlying technology used in the development and commercialization of ILUVIEN. Before entering into the New Collaboration Agreement, we held a worldwide license from EyePoint for the use of steroids, including FAc, in EyePoint&#8217;s proprietary insert technology for the treatment of all ocular diseases other than uveitis. The New Collaboration Agreement expands the license to include uveitis, including NIU-PS, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The New Collaboration Agreement provides us with a license to develop and sell EyePoint&#8217;s proprietary insert technology to deliver other corticosteroids to the back of the eye for the treatment and prevention of eye diseases in humans or to treat DME by delivering a compound to the back of the eye through a direct delivery method through an incision required for a 25-gauge or larger needle. We do not have the right to develop and sell EyePoint&#8217;s proprietary insert technology for indications for diseases outside of the eye anywhere in the world, or for the treatment of uveitis outside of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. EyePoint retained the right to develop and sell EyePoint&#8217;s proprietary insert technology for indications and countries not licensed to us. Further, our agreement with EyePoint permits EyePoint to grant to any other party the right to use its intellectual property (a) to treat DME through an incision smaller than that required for a 25-gauge needle, unless using a corticosteroid delivered to the back of the eye, (b) to deliver any compound outside the back of the eye unless it is to treat DME through an incision required for a 25-gauge or larger needle, or (c) to deliver non-corticosteroids to the back of the eye, unless it is to treat DME through an incision required for a 25-gauge or larger needle. The New Collaboration Agreement converted the previous profit share obligation to a royalty payable on global net revenues of ILUVIEN. We began paying a 2% royalty on net revenues and other related consideration to EyePoint effective July 1, 2017. This royalty amount increased to 6% effective December 12, 2018. We will pay an additional 2% royalty on global net revenues and other related consideration in excess of $75.0 million in any year. During 2021, we recognized approximately $2.9 million of royalty expense. During 2020, we recognized approximately $2.1 million of royalty expense. Following the signing of the New Collaboration Agreement, we retained a right to offset $15.0 million of future royalty payments (the Future Offset). As of December 31, 2021, the balance of the Future Offset was approximately $7.4 million. Our license rights to EyePoint&#8217;s proprietary insert technology could revert to EyePoint if we were to: (a) fail twice to cure our breach of an obligation to make certain payments to EyePoint following receipt of written notice of the breach; (b) fail to cure other breaches of material terms of our agreement with EyePoint within 30 days after notice of such breaches or such longer period (up to 90 days) as may be reasonably necessary if the breach cannot be cured within such 30-day period; (c) file for protection under the bankruptcy laws, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, appoint or suffer appointment of a receiver or trustee over our property, file a petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency act or have any such petition filed against us and such proceeding remains undismissed or unstayed for a period of more than 60 days; or (d) notify EyePoint in writing of our decision to abandon our license with respect to a certain product using EyePoint&#8217;s proprietary insert technology. On December 17, 2020, EyePoint and its parent, EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc., entered into a royalty purchase agreement (the SWK Agreement) with SWK Funding, LLC (SWK). In its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 18, 2020, EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc. stated that pursuant to the SWK Agreement, EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc. sold its interest in royalties that we are obligated to pay EyePoint under the New Collaboration Agreement. EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc. reported that it had received a one-time $16.5 million payment from SWK and, in return, SWK became entitled to receive future royalties that we are obligated to pay to EyePoint under the New Collaboration Agreement. We are not a party to the SWK Agreement. As noted above, we have from time to time amended our license agreement with EyePoint, and we may again seek to do so in the future if the need arises. We believe that given the terms of the SWK Agreement, however, it could be more difficult for us to agree with EyePoint on an amendment to the New Collaboration Agreement, because SWK must consent to any amendment that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the amount of the royalty payments that EyePoint sold to SWK. Similarly, if we were to be engaged in a dispute with EyePoint regarding its enforcement or termination by either party, SWK&#8217;s rights could complicate the resolution of any such dispute. We are not in breach of the New Collaboration Agreement with EyePoint as of the date of this filing. Government Regulation General Overview Government authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate, among other things the research, development, testing, quality, efficacy, safety (pre- and post-marketing), manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, import, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In addition, although third parties manufacture ILUVIEN for us, these manufacturing operations and our research and development activities must follow applicable environmental laws and regulations. The cost to comply with these environmental laws and regulations is not currently significant, but in the future complying with these environmental laws and regulations could increase our costs for manufacturing, research and development. U.S. In the U.S., the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&#38;C Act) and other federal and local statutes and regulations, subjects pharmaceutical products to review. If we do not comply with applicable regulations, the government may refuse to approve or place our clinical studies on clinical hold, refuse to approve our marketing applications, refuse to allow us to manufacture or market our products, seize our products, impose injunctions and monetary fines on us, and prosecute us for criminal offenses. To obtain approval of a new product from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data supporting the safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product and proposed labeling. The testing and collection of data and the preparation of the necessary applications are expensive and time-consuming. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approval that could delay or preclude us from marketing additional products. Once approved by the FDA, a drug requires an annual product and establishment fee, which was approximately $369,000 as of our last renewal in October 2021. Post-Marketing Requirements We are required to meet post-marketing safety surveillance requirements to continue marketing an approved product. We must report any adverse events with the product to the FDA, and the FDA could impose market restrictions through labeling changes or in product removal. The FDA may withdraw product approvals if we fail to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems concerning safety and\/or efficacy of the product occur following approval. The FDA may, at its discretion, also require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. The FDA did not require any post-marketing testing as part of its approval of ILUVIEN. As part of the approval process in Europe, we committed to conduct a five-year, post-authorization, open label registry study in 800 patients treated with ILUVIEN. Due to our post market safety surveillance not showing any unexpected safety signals, we requested and received approval to modify our protocol to cap enrollment in the study. Enrollment was completed with 562 patients. The study was completed in 2020 and the results were submitted to regulatory authorities, fulfilling our post-marketing commitment. The results of the study confirmed existing safety information on ILUVIEN, and no new risks were identified. Also, as part of the approval process in Europe, we are committed to conduct an open label trial in the pediatric population with NIU-PS. We have initiated this trial, and enrollment is expected to start in the second half of 2022. U.S. FDA Regulations With respect to product advertising and promotion of marketed products, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulations that include standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotions, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and Internet promotional activities. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FD&#38;C Act, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in (a) penalties, (b) the issuance of warning letters directing the sponsor to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials must be pre-cleared by the FDA, and (d) federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions (as well as state prosecutions). The manufacturing facility that produces our product, as well as our corporate headquarters facility, must maintain compliance with the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and is subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal and regulatory action, including Warning Letters, seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. Foreign Regulations Foreign regulatory systems, although varying from country to country, include risks similar to those associated with FDA regulations in the U.S. Under the EU regulatory system, applications for drug approval may be submitted either in a centralized or decentralized procedure. Under the centralized procedure, a single application to the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, if approved, would permit marketing of the product throughout the EU (currently 27 member states) and to non-EU countries that are within the EEA. The decentralized procedure provides for applications to be submitted for marketing authorization in a select number of EEA countries. The process is managed by a Reference Member State that coordinates the review process with the other countries in the EEA in which the applicant has applied for marketing authorization. A mutual recognition procedure of nationally approved decisions is available to pursue marketing authorizations for a product in the remaining EU countries. Under the mutual recognition procedure, the holders of national marketing authorization in one of the countries within the EU may submit further applications to other countries within the EU, who will be requested to recognize the original authorization. We chose to pursue the decentralized procedure for ILUVIEN for DME and used the mutual recognition procedure due to our limited resources. Through this procedure, we obtained marketing authorizations in the 17 countries in the EEA discussed above. For ILUVIEN for NIU-PS, we filed a type II variation in these 17 countries in the EEA using the same procedure. In each instance, we received the Final Variation Assessment Report for ILUVIEN from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency of the United Kingdom (the MHRA) based on our submission to the MHRA through the mutual recognition procedure. In light of Brexit, we have moved marketing authorizations for certain European approvals from our U.K. subsidiary to our Irish subsidiary. In addition, Ireland is now our Reference Member State, which is the European Union Member State that leads the review of an application in the decentralized process for ILUVIEN. The Irish Health Products Regulatory Authority is our key regulatory body with which to discuss any regulatory submissions pertinent to ILUVIEN in the EEA. Third-Party Reimbursement and Pricing Controls In the U.S., the EEA and elsewhere, sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third-party payers, such as government and private insurance plans. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, the ACA), significantly changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the ACA became effective beginning in 2010, although some of its key provisions were altered through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. We cannot predict the changes that the new Biden Administration may make to current federal reimbursement policies under this law and whether those changes will affect us. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce our profitability. In many foreign markets, including the countries in the EEA, pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. In the U.S., there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing control. While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of those proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability. For a summary of the countries where we have received reimbursement, see Item 1, &#8220;Business &#8211; Overview &#8211; Where We Market ILUVIEN to Treat Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)&#8221; and &#8220; &#8211; Where We Market ILUVIEN to Treat Recurrent Non-Infectious Uveitis Affecting the Posterior Segment of the Eye (NIU-PS).&#8221; Patents and Proprietary Rights Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for ILUVIEN or any future products or product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Because we license certain intellectual property relating to ILUVIEN from third parties, we depend on their ability to obtain and maintain such protection. Where we have conducted our own research, our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. As of December 31, 2021, we owned or licensed two U.S. utility patents and one U.S. design patent as well as numerous foreign counterparts to many of these patents and patent applications relating to ILUVIEN or the ILUVIEN applicator. We licensed our one utility patent right relating to ILUVIEN from EyePoint. Pursuant to our agreement with EyePoint, our ILUVIEN-related patent rights are only for diseases of the human eye in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and for diseases of the human eye excluding uveitis in the rest of the world. In addition to the U.S. patents licensed from EyePoint, we also license two European patents from EyePoint. We have a U.S. utility patent directed to our applicator system for ILUVIEN. Our licensed patent portfolio includes U.S. patents (with no currently pending or issued corresponding European applications or patents) with claims directed to methods for administering a corticosteroid with an implantable sustained delivery device to deliver the corticosteroid to the vitreous of the eye wherein aqueous corticosteroid concentration is less than vitreous corticosteroid concentration during release. U.S. utility patents generally have a term of 20 years from the date of filing. The utility patent rights relating to ILUVIEN that EyePoint licensed to us include one U.S. patent that will expire August 2027, two European patents that are directed to our low-dose device that expired in April 2021 and will expire in October 2024, respectively, and counterpart filings to these patents in a number of other jurisdictions. No patent term extension or supplementary protection certificate will be available for any of these U.S. or European patents or applications. The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology we develop. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before such product can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Research and Development We invested $4.6 million and $1.3 million in research and development during 2021 and 2020, respectively. Employees As of February 22, 2022, we had 154 employees, 145 of whom were full-time employees. Corporate Information We are a Delaware corporation incorporated on June 4, 2003.

Industry Background Network Traffic Growth and Increased Capacity Requirements The markets in which we sell are dynamic and are characterized by a high rate of change. Optical networks &#8211; which carry video, data and voice traffic by encoding digital information on multiple wavelengths of light traveling across fiber optic cables &#8211; have experienced strong traffic growth. This network traffic growth is being driven by a diverse set of communications services that often require on-demand service levels by enterprise and consumer end users, as well as cloud-based services and applications: &#8226; Cloud-Based Services. Enterprises and consumers continue to replace locally-housed computing and storage by adopting a broad array of innovative cloud-based models &#8211; including Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) &#8211; and an expanding range of cloud-based services that host key applications, store data, enable the viewing and downloading of content, and utilize on-demand computing resources. In addition, content is increasingly moving to the edge of the network, creating new capacity and traffic demands closer to the user. &#8226; Over-the-Top (&#8220;OTT&#8221;) Services and Video Streaming . OTT content refers to video, multimedia and other applications provided directly from the content source to the viewer or end user across a third-party network. Traffic from streaming and OTT services, including high definition and ultra-high definition video, has expanded with the increased availability of, and end-user demand for, video content accessible through a variety of devices and media. &#8226; Mobile Traffic and Applications. Traffic from mobile web applications, including video, internet and data services, has expanded with the continued proliferation of smartphones and other wireless devices. Because much of wireless traffic ultimately travels across a wireline network to reach its destination, growth in mobile communications continues to place demands upon wireline networks, including the backhaul and fronthaul portions of networks emanating from cell sites. &#8226; Residential Access Applications and Enterprise Applications. In recent years we have seen a shift in bandwidth demands, traffic patterns and computing functions to the edge of networks. This trend has been meaningfully accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including due to an increase in remote and hybrid working and work from home arrangements. With a higher percentage of data flows concentrating closer to the edge of the network, more capacity and higher bandwidth to home and enterprise locations is required. These shifts could be permanent, and could influence network architectures and require network operators to adapt. Emerging technologies, services and applications are further impacting or expected to impact network infrastructures, particularly at the edge of networks, where increased computing power and automation are required to meet the quality of experience required by end users. These include: &#8226; 5G . Fifth-generation wireless broadband (&#8220;5G&#8221;) technology is enabling meaningful increases in bandwidth and performance, and enabling emerging applications and services that 4G\/LTE networks cannot support. To fully capitalize on these opportunities, network operators will need to consider the demands 5G technology will place on their wireline infrastructures, including through the addition of additional cell sites as part of the network densification efforts that are paving the way for 5G implementation. &#8226; Fiber Deep and Fiber-Based Access Networks . Similar to 5G, Fiber Deep is a network densification initiative by cable and multiservice operators that seeks to push more digital fiber closer to the end user and to increase potential bandwidth, computing capability and data speeds to homes and enterprises, while at the same time decreasing power, space and operating costs. Wireline service providers are responding to similar trends by pushing fiber to the home and deeper into access networks. &#8226; Internet of Things . As networked connections between devices and servers grow, machine-to-machine-related traffic (&#8220;M2M&#8221;) is expected to represent an increasing portion of traffic. These connections allow sharing of data that can be monitored and analyzed, including in smart grid applications, health care and safety monitoring, resource and inventory management, home entertainment, consumer appliances, connected transportation and other M2M data applications. &#8226; Ultra-High Definition Video (&#8220;UHD&#8221;) and Virtual Reality (&#8220;VR&#8221;) and Augmented Reality (&#8220;AR&#8221;). UHD video and the advent of immersive technologies like VR, AR and 360&#176; video are likely to place further capacity and capability demands on networks as adoption of these technologies grows. Consumer electronics industries are rapidly advancing these technologies and making them more widely available and affordable to consumers. &#8226; Edge Computing . Immersive cloud services and gaming using AR and VR technologies require a low latency environment to provide the required user experience. We expect network operators to increase the number and capabilities of edge computing locations to allow these latency-sensitive workloads to be processed closer to users, which may affect network topologies and traffic patterns. &#8226; Machine Learning (&#8220;ML&#8221;) and Artificial Intelligence (&#8220;AI&#8221;) . As broad foundational technologies that increase network intelligence and improve automation, ML and AI enable improvements in network planning, operations, user experience and trouble resolution. We believe that adoption of these technologies will continue to increase as the IoT expands and additional services are created, and therefore that ML and AI will serve as drivers of further network traffic and solutions innovation. We believe that increased adoption of these technologies, services, and applications and their performance requirements will further increase network traffic and place additional service challenges on network infrastructures, requiring network operator investment in their metro, access and aggregation networks, as well as their core networks. Demand for More Programmable and Automated Networks Network operators continue to invest in the modernization of their businesses, with an objective to create a more digital experience, reduce operational costs and introduce more agility. To achieve this goal, they are adopting next generation infrastructures that combine end-to-end service automation with the deployment of highly programmable infrastructure. We expect network operators will continue to pursue strategies that emphasize one or more of the following: &#8226; Closed Loop Automation. Network operators are seeking to reduce network operating costs and better leverage analytics, automation and control capabilities to automate end-to-end service creation and delivery. Closed loop automation is a continuous cycle of communications between the programmable network infrastructure and software control elements to analyze network conditions, traffic demands, and resource availability and to determine the best placement of traffic for optimal service quality and resource utilization. &#8226; Software-Defined Networking (&#8220;SDN&#8221;). SDN seeks to simplify networks to create more open environments that ease management, support automation and quickly deliver customized services to end users, by enabling individual network elements to be directly programmable by standards-based software control. This results in end-to-end visibility of network flows, enabling the optimization of traffic paths and the control of data flows through a network. &#8226; Network Function Virtualization (&#8220;NFV&#8221;) . NFV is the separation of network services or capabilities from the physical network assets that traditionally provide these services or capabilities to end users. Network operators are increasingly using solutions like NFV, which enables network functions that traditionally would have run on specialized or dedicated hardware to be provided through software that runs on industry-standard servers and network and storage platforms, in order to reduce their dependence on single-purpose hardware and accelerate the time to market for new revenue-generating services. We believe that adoption of these strategies, and the related evolution of core, metro and access network infrastructures, will require network operators and their network solutions vendors to increasingly look to utilize an ecosystem of both physical and virtual network resources, optimized through software. We expect that these network architectural approaches, in turn, will drive increased openness and interoperability of multi-vendor, multi-domain network environments, requiring an increased degree of cooperation, collaboration and interoperability among networking solutions vendors. Different Approaches to Design and Procure Network Infrastructure Solutions Network operators are pursuing a diverse range of approaches, or &#8220;consumption models,&#8221; in their design and procurement of network infrastructure solutions. In addition to purchasing fully integrated network solutions including hardware, software and services from the same vendor, new consumption models include the procurement or use of: &#8226; a fully integrated infrastructure solution from one vendor with the separate use of a network operator&#8217;s own software or that of another vendor; &#8226; integrated photonic line systems with open interfaces from one vendor and the separate or &#8220;disaggregated&#8221; procurement of modem technology from a different vendor; &#8226; open source software in concert with or as an alternative to integrated, proprietary third-party software solutions; &#8226; open IP network operating systems running on off-the-shelf third-party equipment; and &#8226; system integration services or customer self-integration to reconstitute the disaggregated components. Some network operators, including certain of our largest customers, are also pursuing the development and use of published reference designs and open source specifications for the procurement of off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware (often referred to as &#8220;white box&#8221; hardware). This commoditized hardware could be used with in-house developed data path and control software or third-party developed network operating software. Further, a number of network operators are pursuing network strategies that emphasize the deployment of smaller form factor, pluggable modem technology, typically in a switch or router platform, as an alternative to integrated optical platforms that combine purpose-built routers and optical systems. The consumption models that ultimately emerge and their level of adoption will depend in significant part on the circumstances and strategies of certain network operators. While the adoption of these approaches has been limited to date, we expect that continued customer consideration of a variety of consumption models will require network operators and vendors alike to assess, and possibly broaden, their offerings and commercial models over time, thereby placing a premium on a vendor&#8217;s ability to provide robust network solutions with the maximum amount of flexibility and choice. Supply Chain Constraints Due to increased demand across a range of industries, the global supply market for certain raw materials and components, including in particular the semiconductor components used in most of our products, has experienced significant strain in recent periods. These conditions, which became more acute during the second half of fiscal 2021, have been exacerbated in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain challenges, and the strong demand environment. These conditions are impacting a wide range of industries, and across the networking industry, participants are experiencing component shortages, longer lead times and increased cost of components. We believe these supply chain challenges and their adverse impact on our industry will persist at least through the first half of calendar 2022, and may extend into periods thereafter. Industry Consolidation Our industry has experienced significant consolidation in recent years among our competitors, customers and suppliers alike. To drive scale and market share gains, and to meet the intense investment capacity required to keep pace with technology innovation, there has been increased acquisition activity among competing vendors of networking solutions. Acquisition activity has also focused on adding complementary technologies, or accessing adjacent network domains or markets that increase addressable markets of networking vendors. Among our customers, there have been significant horizontal and vertical consolidation activities by communications service providers and cable operators, with several such operators acquiring media and content companies. Customer consolidation can increase their purchasing power and has in the past resulted in delays or reductions in network spending due to changes in strategy or leadership, the timing of regulatory approvals and debt burdens associated with such transactions. Further, significant consolidation among component suppliers may reduce the number of independent suppliers and could create supply challenges affecting our pricing or supply volumes. Consolidation activity across our industry can create opportunities and challenges for our business. We expect this trend to continue, and it may have a significant impact on the entire industry, including our competitive landscape. Product Development &#38; Sustainability In the face of growing network traffic and service expansion, network operators are looking toward network technology innovation as a means to support their business model, to prepare for a low carbon future and to meet the requirements of their stakeholders. Network operators are increasingly looking to their technology vendor partners, who form part of their value and supply chain, as a key element of their overall sustainability strategy to manage the lifecycle impact of their networks, including their related power consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and other resource and environmental impacts. For innovation leaders capable of advancing a development strategy and product roadmap that addresses the network performance and sustainability outcomes sought by network operators, a market transition to a low carbon future and the ability to offer greener technology offerings present meaningful opportunities for enhanced competitive position and business growth for vendors. Strategy Our strategy is to leverage our technology leadership, diversification and global scale to drive the profitable growth of our business. Key elements of this strategy include: Extend Innovation Leadership in Core and Optical Networking. We are focused on using our significant research and development investment capacity to push the pace of innovation in our markets and provide leading offerings that leverage our Adaptive Network vision to make our customers&#8217; networks more dynamic through further advances in programmable network platforms, analytics, control and automation. To strengthen our optical leadership, in fiscal 2021 we brought to market our footprint-optimized, lower power consumption WaveLogic 5 Nano (&#8220;WL5n&#8221;) 100G-400G coherent pluggable transceivers to address next-generation access, metro, regional and data center interconnect network applications. We also introduced innovative intelligent photonics platforms in our 6500 RLS and ELS and are advancing our Converged Packet Optical portfolio for applications in data center interconnection, submarine networks and edge networks. To support our enhanced portfolio and solutions offerings, we intend to grow our attached services business and leverage network transformation with a broader service offering that includes network migration, optimization and multi-vendor network integration. Invest in Next Generation Metro and Edge Networking Solutions. To expand our addressable markets and capture additional opportunities in metro and edge applications we are making significant investments in our Routing and Switching solutions. We are leveraging our optical expertise to offer new architectural approaches to address Metro and Edge network use cases. Among other things, we are developing Routing and Switching solutions with enhanced IP\/Ethernet capabilities, including packet routing, aggregation and switching, 5G cross-haul, Fiber Deep, fiber-based passive optical network (&#8220;PON&#8221;) access, and edge computing. To advance our strategy, and pursue the opportunity for our Routing and Switching solutions to transform the network edge, including 5G networks and cloud environments, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we acquired from AT&#38;T its Vyatta virtual routing and switching technology. Embrace Multiple Consumption Models and Promote Choice. As network operators pursue diverging consumption models, we intend to offer a range of networking solutions across those models to drive the evolution of next-generation network infrastructures and to promote choice in our markets. We are making our technology available in both integrated systems and pluggable form factors that together address a range of technical and economic requirements of network operators pursuing differing consumption models. Specifically, we are pursuing these two distinct product development paths for our next-generation coherent optical chipset to enable this range of solutions, and, in fiscal 2021 we introduced our WL5n 100G-400G coherent pluggable transceivers for next-generation access, metro, regional and data center interconnect network applications. Separately, through our Optical Microsystems business we are pursuing sales opportunities that leverage our WaveLogic technology in the form of high-performance transceivers\/modems &#8211; the combination of a Ciena-designed optical chipset and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) with other key optical components and sold independently of integrated systems. Consistent with industry practice, we sell our transceiver\/modem technology in the form of an optical module or pluggable to a variety of market participants, including other original equipment manufacturers with whom we compete. By addressing multiple consumption models, we seek to secure a larger portion of the world&#8217;s optical network wavelengths, expand our addressable market and access new customer verticals and applications. We expect this may require us to continue to broaden our existing product offering beyond traditional hardware systems and to expand our commercial models over time. Promote Enhanced Software Automation. We seek to improve network layer automation and programmability by advancing our microservices-based domain controller Manage, Control and Plan (&#8220;MCP&#8221;) software. We are also focused on gaining adoption and expanding application for our Adaptive IP software, leveraging our Service-Aware Operating System (&#8220;SAOS&#8221;) embedded in our Routing and Switching products. We also seek to promote broader adoption of our Blue Planet Automation Software, highlighting its ability to transform network operations and management and reduce the need for manual intervention in key operational processes. In so doing, we believe that Blue Planet can help customers with their digital transformations by transitioning legacy networks into &#8220;service ready&#8221; networks, accelerating the creation, delivery and lifecycle management of new services. To expand our addressable market, we are pursuing opportunities for our Blue Planet Automation Software platform in enterprise-related applications. We are also investing in Blue Planet-related services and seek to use insights from common business, operational and networking challenges to position our Blue Planet solutions as the means by which to achieve the digital network transformation sought by our customers. A key part of our strategy is to grow our software business as a portion of our total business through expanded customer adoption and broader applications, and to gain adoption of recurring and subscription-based models. Focus Diversification on High-Growth Applications and Customer Segments. We believe that the continued diversification of our business is important to address the dynamic industry environment in which we operate, to continue to grow our business, and to better withstand potential slowdowns adversely affecting particular geographies, markets or customer segments. A key part of our strategy is to continue to diversify our solutions offerings, customer base and geographic reach to address fast-growing applications and markets, including those that are adjacent to or complementary with our current addressable market. Our go-to-market strategy seeks to capture additional market share with existing customers and emerging network operators, and to displace competitors, particularly in international markets.

With its modern software architecture, open APIs, and common data models, Waveserver is easy to operate and integrate into existing networks and facilitates deployment of on-demand cloud and high-capacity connectivity services. Our 6500 Reconfigurable Line System (RLS) is a compact, simple-to-deploy, disaggregated intelligent photonic layer line system that improves scalability, reduces footprint, and offers more flexibility and programmability. Its applications include long-haul and metro data center interconnection and general network modernization and simplification. It offers double fiber capacity through automated C- and L-band deployments and provides highly dense remote optical add\/drop multiplexing and switching features that enable network operators to react to unpredictable traffic requirements by scaling connectivity and capacity. Our 5400 family of Packet-Optical Platforms consist of multi-terabit reconfigurable switching systems that consolidate the functionality of an add\/drop multiplexer and a digital cross-connect into a single, high-capacity intelligent switching system. These products address both core and metro segments of communications networks and support key managed services, including Ethernet\/TDM Private Line and IP services. These products provide for optical transport, traffic aggregation at the network edge and switching that are optimized for handoff at the network core. Our coherent-optimized edge line system, Coherent ELS, is a high-capacity disaggregated line system that is designed to address next-generation access photonic line system requirements, including the transport of coherent wavelengths originating from pluggables, through a compact, hardened form factor designed to accommodate outside plant deployments. With a focus on reducing operational complexity, our Coherent ELS open line system (OLS) uses integrated intelligence and automation to simplify and scale deployments. As discussed above, in fiscal 2021 we brought to market our footprint-optimized WL5n 100G-400G coherent pluggable transceivers to address next-generation access, metro, regional and data center interconnect network applications. However, our entrance into the market for high-performance coherent transceiver module and pluggable opportunities remains in the early stages, and revenue has not been significant to date. Sales of our Optical Microsystems products are reflected within the Converged Packet Optical product line of our Networking Platforms segment. Routing and Switching. Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2021, we renamed our &#8220;Packet Networking&#8221; product line &#8220;Routing and Switching.&#8221; Our Routing and Switching portfolio includes products and solutions that enable next-generation metro, access and aggregation or &#8220;edge&#8221; networks, including solutions that allow customers to simplify their network designs while delivering new, revenue-generating services. These products route, aggregate and switch packet-based traffic to support such applications as IP services, Ethernet business services, cell site routing, mobile cross-haul, converged haul and services, Fiber Deep, and consumer\/residential access, as well as ongoing network infrastructure scaling. Our Routing and Switching products are based on our Adaptive IP approach, which delivers end-to-end IP-based services in an automated and more simplified manner than traditional IP network designs. Our Routing and Switching products enable operators to achieve improved network cost effectiveness, including reduced costs associated with power and space, as compared to more complex, traditional IP routing. Our 3900 family of Service Delivery Platforms and our 5000 family of Service Aggregation Platforms support network access and aggregation, respectively, and have been principally deployed to support IP and Ethernet business services and wireless front haul, backhaul and mid-backhaul applications. Our 3900 family of platforms are purpose-built to fit small to large customer sites as well as multi-tenant office and residential buildings and edge office or outside plant applications. They also allow customers to migrate toward software-based networking and services based on NFV. Our 5000 family provides aggregation to fill higher capacity links within both the metro access and aggregation tiers of networks, allowing operators to reduce the number of router assets required in the core and to better implement edge cloud architectures. Our 6500 Packet Transport System (&#8220;PTS&#8221;) combines packet switching, control plane operation and integrated optics. Together with our 3900 platforms, PTS enables our service provider customers to migrate their legacy TDM (SONET\/SDH\/PDH) services to a scalable, lower operational cost packet solution. Our 8100 Coherent IP networking platforms combine high capacity IP routing and switching with high capacity coherent optical transport technologies for next-generation metro and edge applications. Our Routing and Switching portfolio also includes our 8700 Packetwave Platform, a multi-terabit packet switching platform for high-density metro networks and inter-data center wide area networks. The 8700 combines packet switching and coherent WaveLogic DWDM optical transport technologies for both data center networks and metro networks. Employed within our Routing and Switching platforms is our SAOS, which provides the software-based IP capabilities to support 5G, IP VPN services, access, PON, converged interconnect network (CIN) architectures, coherent optical transport, and NFV. Our Routing and Switching portfolio will also include the Vyatta virtual routing and switching technology that we acquired from AT&#38;T in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Platform Software and Services Our software offerings also include our Platform Software, which provides domain control management, analytics, data and planning tools to assist customers in managing our Networking Platforms products in their networks, including by creating more efficient operations and more proactive visibility into their networks. Our Platform Software includes: &#8226; Manage, Control and Plan . MCP software provides intelligent network control of our routing, switching and optical solutions, enabling simplification, acceleration and automation of multi-layer network operations. Our suite of MCP applications integrate software control and analytics applications in a unified interface which provides network performance data. Our MCP domain controller provides fault, configuration, accounting, performance and security (&#8220;FCAPS&#8221;) management for multi-layer networks, in combination with services management and online network planning. MCP simplifies multi-layer lifecycle operations &#8211; including equipment commissioning, service provisioning, service assurance and performance monitoring. MCP provides this functionality for Ciena-developed products as well as a number of products developed by other vendors where they form a unified solution.

To complement our Platform Software portfolio, we offer a range of related services that include software subscription services, consulting, network migration and integration, installation and upgrade support services, and technical support relating to our Platform Software offerings. These services are focused on enabling our customers to operate their Ciena networks most efficiently, and to modernize their operations. Our Platform Software offering also includes planning tools and a number of legacy software solutions, including our OneControl unified management system, that support our installed base of network solutions. As we achieve further customer adoption of our MCP software platform, and as we transition features, functionality and customers to that platform, we expect revenue to decline for our legacy Platform Software solutions. Blue Planet Automation Software and Services Our Blue Planet Automation Software is a comprehensive, cloud native, and standards-based software portfolio that enables customers to realize digital transformation through the automation of the services lifecycle. Our Blue Planet applications are open and modular, and can be deployed either individually or in any combination. These applications include: &#8226; Multi-Domain Service Orchestration (MDSO). Network infrastructures are comprised of multiple technology layers and domains &#8211; such as the data center, cloud, metro, access and core networks &#8211; and it is often complex for network operators to offer end-to-end services in this environment. Blue Planet enables service orchestration across multiple physical and virtual network domains, multiple layers (Optical, Ethernet, IP and Mobile) and multiple hardware and software vendors. &#8226; Inventory (&#8220;BPI&#8221;). By integrating or &#8220;federating&#8221; data from multiple inventory systems and presenting it in a single dynamic view, BPI allows real-time visibility into the topology and status of network and service resources from end to end. Integrating with legacy operation support systems (&#8220;OSS&#8221;), BPI helps network providers simplify key operational processes such as service fulfillment, network planning and service assurance. &#8226; Route Optimization and Analysis (&#8220;ROA&#8221;). ROA combines routing, traffic and performance analytics for real-time monitoring of IP services across the cloud. These capabilities enable troubleshooting of latent or transient network problems and modeling to predict the impact of network infrastructure, service and workload changes to build more resilient networks. &#8226; NFV Orchestration (&#8220;NFVO&#8221;) . Blue Planet provides NFV management and orchestration capabilities for creating and managing virtualized network functions and data center resources. NFVO uses an open, vendor-agnostic approach that allows network operators to select and scale those virtual network functions (&#8220;VNFs&#8221;) they wish to offer to customers. &#8226; Unified Assurance &#38; Analytics (&#8220;UAA&#8221;). UAA leverages multi-layer\/multi-domain assurance and AI-powered analytics to provide insights into the health and performance of network resources and services, ensuring an end-customer quality of experience and availability to meet dynamic service demands. &#8226; Blue Planet Services .

These services are focused on enhancing network automation and network analytics, enabling multi-vendor integration and support, and implementing programmable multi-domain next-generation networks. The Blue Planet Automation Software portfolio when used together allows operators to fulfill services rapidly and to meet end-customer quality-of-experience expectations via an entire services lifecycle approach, thus accelerating network operators towards their vision of self-healing and self-optimizing closed loop automation. Our entrance into the market relating to these software automation capabilities remains in the early stages and, as such, revenue from our Blue Planet Automation Software and Services segment continues to represent a relatively small portion of our total revenue. Global Services To complement our Networking Platforms portfolio, we offer a broad suite of value-added services that help our customers to build, operate and improve their networks. We believe that our services offerings and our close collaboration with our customers provide us with valuable insight into the network and business challenges they face, allowing us to provide services to meet their desired business outcomes. We have completed a multi-year transformation process to enhance our service delivery capabilities, reorganizing our resources into regional service delivery and customer success functions to better serve our customers, and streamlining our services cost structure. At the same time, we have broadened our services portfolio to include additional advanced services, including network migration and transformation, optimization, and multi-vendor service capabilities. Through these transformation initiatives, we believe that we can improve the cost model of our services offerings and drive greater business value for our customers. Our Global Services portfolio includes a range of offerings to meet customer needs and maximize their network infrastructure investment throughout the network lifecycle. These include: &#8226; Build. Consulting and network design services to enhance network performance or migrate to next-generation infrastructures, implementation services to facilitate proper planning and design, installation and deployment services, and systems integration services to integrate third-party solutions; &#8226; Operate.

These services are delivered using a combination of our internal services resources, technical support engineers, and qualified and authorized third-party service partners. Product Development To remain competitive, we must continually invest in and enhance our solutions offerings, addressing new market opportunities, adding new features and functionality and ensuring alignment with market demand. Our product development efforts seek to design and bring to market solutions that leverage our Adaptive Network vision to make our customers&#8217; networks more adaptive through further advances in programmable systems and software, analytics, and control and automation. Through our development efforts, we seek to support network operators as they pursue new business models and sources of revenue from their network infrastructure, and to achieve improved economics and return on their network infrastructure investment. We seek to develop products aimed at optimizing price for performance, power consumption, space requirements, service enablement, lifecycle operating costs and the environmental impact of their network operations. Our approach is also focused on designing products that address a range of emerging consumption models for networking solutions. Our current development efforts are focused on: &#8226; Reinforcing our coherent optical leadership with continued development that advances reach, transmission speed and spectral efficiency, including by leading in intelligent photonics; &#8226; Executing on parallel innovation paths for our next generation modem technology, including expanding our WaveLogic 5 Nano offerings; &#8226; Delivering on the Adaptive IP approach and extending the IP\/routing capabilities and use cases of our Routing and Switching solutions to support mobile network cross-haul, edge cloud, and network densification and virtualization initiatives, such as 5G, Fiber Deep and residential access; &#8226; Pursuing development to address different consumption models, including our module, pluggable, component, disaggregated IP NOS and VNF development initiatives; &#8226; Enhancing our Adaptive Network vision through advances in hardware programmability and software-based domain control, automation and analytics through MCP and purpose-built applications; and &#8226; Advancing our software-led transformation strategy and product development for our Blue Planet Automation Software to enable generation OSS transformation and closed loop automation. Our research and development efforts are also geared toward portfolio optimization and engineering changes intended to drive product and manufacturing cost reductions across our platforms. We regularly review our existing solutions offerings and prospective development of new components, features or products in order to determine their fit within our portfolio and broader corporate strategy. We also assess the market demand, technology evolution, prospective return on investment and growth opportunities, as well as the costs and resources necessary to develop and support these products. To ensure that our product development investments and solutions offerings are closely aligned with market demand, we continually seek input from customers and promote collaboration among our product development, marketing and sales organizations. In some cases, where we seek to utilize or gain access to complementary or emerging technologies or solutions, we may obtain technology through an acquisition or, alternatively, through initiatives with third parties pursuant to technology licenses, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) arrangements and other strategic technology relationships or investments. In addition, we participate in industry and standards organizations and, where appropriate, incorporate information from these affiliations throughout the product development process. Customer Engagement Our Global Customer Engagement organization includes a direct sales presence that is organized geographically around the following markets: (i) the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Latin America (&#8220;Americas&#8221;); (ii) Europe, Middle East and Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;); and (iii) Asia Pacific, Japan and India (&#8220;APAC&#8221;). Within each geographic area, we maintain specific teams or personnel that focus on a particular region, country, customer or market vertical, or portfolio. These teams include sales management, account salespersons and sales engineers, as well as partner resources, field marketing, services professionals and commercial management personnel, who ensure that we maintain a high-touch, consultative relationship with our customers. We also maintain a global partner program that includes distributors, resellers, systems integrators, service providers and other third-party distributors who market and sell our products and services. We utilize these third-party channel partners to market and sell our solutions into specific geographies, applications or customer verticals. We believe there are opportunities to leverage these relationships to expand our addressable market, while at the same time reducing the financial and operational risk of entering additional markets. For third parties in our Ciena Partner Network, we maintain a code of conduct that is available on our website and that sets forth our expectations for the high standards of ethical and legally compliant conduct we require of them in supporting our business. To support our global customer engagement efforts, we invest in marketing activities to generate demand for our products and services. Our marketing strategy is highly focused on building our brand to create customer preference for Ciena, engaging in thought leadership programs to illustrate how our innovations solve customer business problems, and enabling our sales teams to drive customer adoption of our solutions. Our marketing team supports our sales efforts through a variety of activities, including direct customer interaction, account-based marketing campaigns, portfolio marketing, industry events, media relations, industry analyst relations, social media, trade shows, our website and other marketing vehicles for our customers and channel partners. Operations and Supply Chain Management Our operations personnel manage the relationships with our third-party manufacturers and global supply chain, addressing component sourcing, manufacturing, product testing and quality, and fulfillment and logistics relating to the distribution and support of our products. We utilize a sourcing strategy that emphasizes global procurement of materials and product manufacturing in lower cost regions. We rely upon third-party contract manufacturers, including those with facilities in Canada, Mexico, Thailand and the United States, to manufacture, support and ship our products, and therefore are exposed to risks associated with their businesses, financial condition and the geographies in which they operate, including political risk, changes in tax and trade policy involving such countries, and physical risk, including the impact of climate change in such geographies. We also rely upon contract manufacturers and other third parties to perform design and prototype development, component procurement, full production, final assembly, testing and distribution operations. Our manufacturers procure components necessary for assembly and manufacture of our products based on our specifications, approved vendor lists, bills of materials and testing and quality standards. Our manufacturers&#8217; activity is based on rolling forecasts that we provide to them to estimate demand for our products. We work closely with our manufacturers and suppliers to manage material, quality, cost and delivery times, and we continually evaluate their services to ensure performance on a reliable and cost-effective basis. Generally, our agreements with our supply chain and contract manufacturers are frame agreements against which we place purchase orders and do not represent long-term commitments. We currently use distribution partners to fulfill and deliver our products. We believe that our sourcing, manufacturing and distribution strategies allow us to conserve capital, lower costs of product sales, adjust quickly to changes in market demand and operate without dedicating significant resources to manufacturing-related plant and equipment. We continue to focus on a range of initiatives that seek to optimize our operations, improve our resiliency, and drive cost reductions. We seek to balance these goals through our sourcing and supply chain strategy, outsourcing and use of lower cost geographies. Our efforts also include process optimization initiatives, such as vendor-managed inventory, and other operational models and strategies designed to drive improved efficiencies in our sourcing, production, logistics and fulfillment. We actively work with our third-party vendors and business partners to promote socially responsible business practices within our own business and those within our global supply chain. To that end, we have adopted the principles set forth in the Responsible Business Alliance (&#8220;RBA&#8221;) Code of Conduct. The RBA Code of Conduct establishes standards that aim to ensure working conditions in the electronics industry, or industries in which electronics are a key component, and its supply chains are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that business operations are environmentally responsible and conducted ethically. We promote these principles and require our suppliers to adhere to these same standards. We also publish a Sustainability Report, which includes more detail about our efforts to promote responsible business practices. For a discussion of actions taken to manage through the ongoing global supply chain constraints, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Overview - Supply Chain Constraints&#8221; in Item 7 of Part II of this report. Seasonality Like other companies in our industry, we experience quarterly fluctuations in customer activity due to seasonal considerations. We typically experience reductions in order volume toward the end of the calendar year, as the procurement cycles of some of our customers slow and network deployment activity by service providers is curtailed. This period coincides with the first quarter of our fiscal year. This seasonality in our order flows has often resulted in weaker revenue results in the first quarter of our fiscal year. These seasonal effects may not apply consistently in future periods and may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue or results of operations. Competition Competition among networking solution vendors remains intense on a global basis. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, frequent introduction of new solutions and aggressive selling efforts, including using significant pricing pressure to displace incumbent vendors and capture market share. Competition for sales of networking solutions, including our Networking Platforms and Platform Software and Services, is dominated by a small number of very large, multi-national companies. Our competitors include Huawei, Nokia, Cisco, Juniper Networks and ZTE. As compared to us, many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, operational and marketing resources, significantly broader product offerings and more established relationships with service providers and other customer segments. Because of their scale and resources, they may be perceived to be a better fit for the procurement or network strategies of larger network operators. We also continue to compete with several smaller but established companies that offer one or more products that compete directly or indirectly with our offerings or whose products address specific niches within the markets and customer segments we address. These competitors include Infinera, ADVA and Ribbon Communications. We also compete with a number of companies that provide significant competition for a specific product, application, service, customer segment or geographic market. Keeping pace with the market&#8217;s demands for technology innovation requires considerable research and development investment capacity. As a result, some of our competitors, both large and small, have chosen to rely upon component and module technology developed by and procured from third-party providers, including NTT Electronics (&#8220;NEL&#8221;), Marvell Technology Group (which acquired Inphi) and Cisco (which acquired Acacia Communications). We may compete with these providers, either indirectly as a result of their technology being a key enabling technology for our competitors or an alternative consumption model such as &#8220;whitebox&#8221; technology, or directly in module, pluggable and component sales opportunities. As we promote our corporate strategy and seek increased customer adoption of our Blue Planet Automation Software, we expect to compete more directly with software vendors and traditional IT services vendors. Competitors for our Blue Planet Automation Software include Cisco, Nokia, Amdocs, Netcracker and Ericsson. Across our markets and segments, the principal competitive factors can include, among others: &#8226; the ability to meet business needs and drive successful outcomes; &#8226; functionality, speed, capacity, scalability and performance of network solutions; &#8226; price for performance, cost per bit and total cost of ownership of network solutions; &#8226; incumbency and strength of existing business relationships; &#8226; technology roadmap and forward innovation capacity, including the ability to invest significant sums in research and development; &#8226; time-to-market in delivering products and features; &#8226; company stability and financial health; &#8226; ability to offer comprehensive networking solutions, consisting of hardware, software and services; &#8226; flexibility and openness of platforms, including ease of integration, interoperability and integrated management; &#8226; ability to offer solutions that accommodate a range of different consumption models; &#8226; operating costs, space requirements and power consumption of network solutions; &#8226; software and network automation capabilities; &#8226; ability to manage challenging supply chain environments, including manufacturing and lead-time capability; and &#8226; services and support capabilities. As a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate, winning new opportunities can often require that we agree to unfavorable commercial terms or pricing and other onerous contractual commitments. In so doing, our expectation is that we can recover or improve the economics of such relationships over time. However, these terms can adversely affect our results of operations in any period. These terms can also lengthen our revenue recognition or cash collection cycles, add start-up costs to initial sales or deployment of our solutions, require financial commitments or performance bonds, and place a disproportionate allocation of risk upon us. Our competitive landscape has been and is likely to continue to be impacted by pending international trade and related matters, in particular between the U.S. and China. For example, in May 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce amended the Export Administration Regulations by adding Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and certain affiliates to the &#8220;Entity List,&#8221; resulting in significant new restrictions on export, reexport and transfer of U.S. regulated technologies and products to Huawei. In August 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce added additional Huawei affiliates to the Entity List, confirmed the expiration of a temporary general license applicable to Huawei, and amended the foreign direct product rule under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations in a manner that significantly expanded its application to Huawei. Separately, the U.S. has taken steps to restrict federal agencies from doing business with, and U.S. wireless carriers from using federal subsidies to buy equipment from, Huawei and ZTE. The U.S. has also encouraged other governments to consider similar restrictions. These actions have resulted in escalating tensions between the United States and China and introduce a risk that the Chinese government may take additional steps to retaliate against U.S. industries or companies. We also expect the competition in our industry to continue to broaden and to intensify as network operators pursue a diverse range of network strategies and consumption models. As these changes occur, we expect that our business will overlap more directly with additional networking solution suppliers, including IP router vendors, data center switch providers and other suppliers or integrators of networking technology traditionally geared toward different network applications, layers or functions. We may also face competition from system and component vendors, including those in our supply chain, who develop pluggable modem technology or other networking products based on off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware technology, referred to as &#8220;white box&#8221; hardware, particularly where a customer&#8217;s network strategy seeks to emphasize deployment of such product offerings or to adopt a disaggregated approach to the procurement of hardware and software. Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property Rights The success of our business and technology leadership depends significantly on our proprietary and internally developed technology. We rely upon the intellectual property protections afforded by patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to establish, maintain and enforce rights in our proprietary technologies and product branding. We regularly file applications for patents and have a significant number of patents in the United States and other countries where we do business. As of December 1, 2021, we had approximately 2,000 issued patents and more than 500 pending patent applications worldwide. Enforcing proprietary rights, especially patents, can be costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps that we are taking will detect, prevent, or minimize the risks of all unauthorized use. The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We have been subject to several claims related to patent infringement, and we have been requested to indemnify customers pursuant to contractual indemnity obligations relating to infringement claims made by third parties. Intellectual property infringement assertions could cause us to incur substantial costs, including settlement costs and legal fees in the defense of related actions. If we are not successful in defending these claims, our business could be adversely affected. Our operating system software, Platform Software, Blue Planet Automation Software and other solutions incorporate software and components under licenses from third parties, including software subject to various open source software licenses. Failure to obtain or maintain such licenses or other third-party intellectual property rights could affect our development efforts and market opportunities, or could require us to re-engineer our products or to obtain alternate technologies. Moreover, there is a risk that open source and other technology licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. Governmental Regulations Environmental Matters Our business and operations are subject to environmental laws in various jurisdictions around the world, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) regulations adopted by the European Union (the &#8220;EU&#8221;). We are also subject to disclosure and related requirements that apply to the presence of &#8220;conflict minerals&#8221; in our products or supply chain. We seek to operate our business in compliance with applicable laws relating to the materials and content of our products and product takeback and recycling. Environmental regulation is increasing, particularly outside of the United States, and we expect that our domestic and international operations may be subject to additional environmental compliance requirements, which could require us to incur additional costs. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to environmental regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Our innovation efforts and our environmental sustainability initiatives are closely linked. Our product development efforts focus on allowing network operators to continually &#8220;do more with less.&#8221; We promote environmental sustainability through our efforts to improve the energy efficiency per gigabit of throughput in our high-performance networking solutions, as well as our initiatives to improve power, space and cooling requirements, and to reduce the total number of network elements required to operate a network. We pursue opportunities to minimize the resource impacts in our product design and sourcing, and to assess and improve efficiencies over the life cycle of our products, including packaging and distribution, and end-of-life reuse, refurbishment, and recycling. We make CDP climate change and water disclosures and are a member of the RBA. We have adopted, and seek to ensure that our key direct suppliers adopt, the standards and principles set forth in the RBA Code of Conduct. Other Regulations As a company with global operations, we are subject to complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including trade regulations, tariffs, import and export regulations, anti-bribery and corruption laws, antitrust or competition laws, data privacy laws, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the &#8220;GDPR&#8221;), and environmental regulations, among others. We have policies and procedures in place to promote compliance with these laws and regulations. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Government regulations are subject to change, and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business in the future. For further discussion of how government regulations may affect our business, see the related discussion in &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Related to Intellectual Property, Litigation, Regulation and Government Policy.&#8221; People and Culture Our technology solutions are developed, marketed, sold and supported by the talented individuals that make up our 7,241 person global workforce as of October 30, 2021, over 99% of whom were full-time employees. We have a broad base of talent in more than 35 countries, with approximately 59% in the Americas, 33% in APAC, and 8% in EMEA, the majority of whom are in engineering, operations or sales roles. We understand that our industry and innovation leadership is ultimately rooted in people. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology space is intense, and our success depends in large part on our ability to recruit, develop and retain a productive and engaged workforce. Accordingly, investing in our employees and their wellbeing, offering competitive compensation and benefits, and adopting progressive human capital management practices constitute a core element of our corporate strategy. Our Board of Directors oversees our corporate strategy, which includes management&#8217;s design and execution of our &#8220;people strategy.&#8221; This strategy seeks to ensure that we continue to attract and retain the talent necessary to execute on our business plans, and that we have programs, initiatives, rewards and recognition that are well aligned and support these goals. We launched our &#8220;People Promise&#8221; during fiscal 2020 and honor this promise by promoting a workplace environment where our employees are empowered, feel included and have an opportunity to make a difference through their work at Ciena. In doing so, we seek to cultivate for employees a culture of vibrancy, belonging and happiness, while enabling us to be an attractive employer of choice within our markets. Our executive team is actively involved in and sponsors key initiatives and employee resource groups intended to promote this corporate culture. To that end, our people strategy is focused on the following: &#8226; Promote Belonging through Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives. We promote an inclusive and diverse workplace, where all individuals are respected and feel they belong regardless of their age, race, national origin, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity through recruiting outreach, internal networking and resource groups, inclusivity networks, and mentoring programs. As of October 30, 2021, our global workforce was approximately 20.6% female. Our Board of Directors is 30% female and 20% ethnically diverse. As of December 31, 2020, in the U.S., where we are headquartered, our approximately 1,700 employee workforce approximately reflected the following ethnicities: 64.6% White, 22.5% Asian, 6.0% Hispanic or Latino, 4.4% Black or African American, 2.0% two or more races (Not Hispanic or Latino), and 0.5% additional groups (including American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). We are deeply committed to increasing diversity in our workforce at all levels, and regularly monitor our recruitment process with an aim to improve the diversity of our workforce and candidate pool. Our commitment to providing an inclusive workplace is demonstrated through the introduction of our Conscious Inclusion Workshops which have had 100% participation by our executive leadership and 58% by our managers as of the end of fiscal 2021. In addition, we support multiple active internal networking and resource groups, including our Women@Ciena group, Black &#38; African Heritage group, Pride@Ciena LGBT+ group, and our Ciena Next early in career group, and we launched our LatinX group in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2021, we also ran an eight-month targeted development pilot with our Black &#38; African Heritage group, aimed at strengthening individuals&#8217; sense of belonging and enhancing communication and financial acumen. We also maintain a global Inclusivity Council, which is led by two of our executives and aims to address actions for inclusion, and we have signed The CEO Action for Diversity &#38; Inclusion. &#8226; Support Employee Wellbeing and Engagement. We prioritize supporting the overall wellbeing of our employees from a physical, mental and emotional, financial and social perspective. We also regularly seek input from employees, including through employee engagement and pulse surveys on specific issues that are intended to assess our degree of success in promoting an environment that supports our People Promise and measure our culture of compliance and employee comprehension of our business goals. Our fiscal 2021 employee engagement survey had a participation rate of approximately 75% and resulted in engagement scores across all indexes that met or exceeded industry benchmarks. Our global wellbeing program includes a long-standing practice of remote and flexible working arrangements, flexible paid time off in many of our geographies, life planning and retirement readiness programming, wellness platforms and expense reimbursement benefits, fitness challenges and rewards, 24x7 crisis support and employee assistance program, and mental health coaching. &#8226; Offer Competitive Compensation and Ensure Pay Equity. We strive to ensure that our employees receive competitive, fair and transparent compensation and progressive benefits offerings. We conduct an annual pay fairness assessment of gender globally and of ethnicity in the U.S. and Canada, and take action to ensure we are paying individuals performing similar work equitably, and recently adopted analytic software to enable better global pay fairness assessments. To align performance and stockholder interest, we base our annual incentive compensation on both business and individual performance, we maintain an employee stock purchase plan and we have provided broader employee opportunities for equity compensation in recent years. We also offer competitive family leave, including global family leave to support employees throughout various life stages, carer&#8217;s leave, bereavement leave, parental leave that includes a minimum of 18 weeks paid time off for new mothers (including eight weeks recovery and ten weeks bonding) and ten weeks paid time off for new fathers and adoptive parents, and financial assistance for adoptive parents. We offer meaningful retirement benefits and programming to promote retirement readiness among our employee base. In recent years, we have enhanced employer contributions to our North America retirement plans, added our first ESG fund option for employees and, as of October 30, 2021, greater than 99% of our eligible employees in the U.S. and Canada were participating in our defined contribution retirement plans. &#8226; Provide Programs for Employee Recognition. We also offer rewards and recognition programs to our employees, including awards to recognize employees who best exemplify our core values, &#8220;applause&#8221; and spot awards to recognize employee contributions, patent incentive and distinguished engineer awards, and awards recognizing employees who exemplify our commitment to our communities and volunteerism. We believe that providing these recognition programs helps drive strong employee performance. &#8226; Create Opportunities for Growth and Development. As of October 30, 2021, approximately 19% of our employees are &#8220;early in career,&#8221; or age 30 and under, 53% are &#8220;mid-career,&#8221; or age 31 to 50, and 28% are &#8220;late in career,&#8221; or age 51 and over.

We also operate a leadership succession planning process that aims to develop and retain key talent and ensure business continuity for key roles. &#8226; Promote Community Outreach and Support. We believe it is important to give back and promote community outreach and support through corporate giving, charitable matching, and employee volunteerism in the communities in which we live and work. Through our &#8220;Ciena Cares&#8221; community program, we provide corporate matching of employee charitable donations, flexible volunteering during work time, and corporate rewards for service hours that can be donated by employees. In fiscal 2020, we launched our digital inclusion initiative, which aims to mobilize our global workforce, leverage our innovation leadership, and collaborate with customers, suppliers and other partners to bridge the digital divide. Through this initiative, we have funded programming to support underserved students in our global communities by emphasizing digital inclusion and equity through greater connectivity, access to enabling technologies and digital skills development. We have also partnered with Tree-Nation by planting a tree for each existing and new employee at Ciena. &#8226; Promote a Strong Ethical Business Culture. We believe that commitments to good corporate governance and the highest ethical standards are essential to our long-term success, and are dedicated to instilling in our employees a commitment to integrity and business ethics. We maintain a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that sets standards of conduct for Ciena&#8217;s directors, officers and employees. All employees are required to complete training on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and we conduct recurring employee affirmations with respect to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and periodic training and communication related to specific topics contained therein. In addition, we maintain a Corporate Compliance Committee that promotes integrity and compliance leadership throughout Ciena, and in 2020 we created and resourced a new dedicated function focused exclusively on Compliance and Ethics. We also maintain several easily accessible internal and external methods by which our employees, business partners, and investors can report concerns relating to the ethical operation of our business, including anonymously where permitted. We conduct surveys of all employees on our compliance program and culture of integrity in order to assess and strengthen our culture and practices and received feedback from approximately 75% of our employees in fiscal 2021. Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic . In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have prioritized the safety of our employees and business partners, while continuing to support the needs of our customers and communities during this unprecedented period. &#8226; Employees. As of the end of fiscal 2021, most of our offices remain closed with limited exceptions or for certain geographies where conditions and local regulations permit, or for a small number of employees in certain key roles. We have adopted a comprehensive set of global site reopening guidelines, which specify the requirements for and limited circumstances under which we will consider reopening one or more of our offices during the ongoing pandemic. Since the onset of the pandemic, most of our employees have worked from home on a regular basis, using digital platforms and virtual collaboration tools to maintain productivity and to remain in contact with one another and our business partners. To support and protect our employees, we have also: instituted travel bans and restrictions and taken meaningful precautions in accordance with relevant guidelines to protect the health and safety of the small number of employees who need to be in offices, laboratory environments or at customer or partner sites to perform their roles. We have adopted new employee benefits and wellbeing initiatives, including physical, emotional, mental, and social programming, global pandemic leave, and work from home reimbursement benefits. We have also hosted regular mental wellbeing sessions, internal communication and morale initiatives, and launched new wellbeing platforms that focus on the mental and emotional health needs of our employees during this time. &#8226; Community . In an unprecedented time, we and our global workforce have focused on service and compassion. We have undertaken a range of volunteering and charitable actions to support our neighbors and communities. Among other things, during fiscal 2021 we adopted an enterprise-level goal for our employees to volunteer and provide service to their communities. We have also created and advanced a new community initiative focused on promoting digital inclusion, providing greater opportunities for underserved students through improved access, technology and digital skills, and have undertaken joint community projects with business partners as part of this program.

(the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a Pennsylvania corporation organized in 2008 and registered as a bank holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;). The Company was formed for purposes of acquiring Embassy Bank For The Lehigh Valley (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;) in connection with the reorganization of the Bank into a bank holding company structure, which was consummated on November 11, 2008. The reorganization enabled the Company to better compete and grow in its competitive and rapidly changing marketplace. Accordingly, the Company owns all of the capital stock of the Bank, giving the organization more flexibility in meeting its capital needs as the Company continues to grow. The Bank, which is the Company&#8217;s principal operating subsidiary, was originally incorporated as a Pennsylvania bank on May 11, 2001 and opened its doors on November 6, 2001. It was formed by a group of local business persons and professionals with significant prior experience in community banking in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania, the Bank&#8217;s primary market area. Mission The Company provides a traditional range of financial products and services to meet the depository and credit needs of individual consumers, small and medium sized businesses, and professionals in its market area. As a locally owned and operated community bank, there is a strong focus on service that is highly personalized, efficient, and responsive to local needs. It is the intention of the Company to deliver its products and services with the care and professionalism expected of a community bank and with a special dedication to personalized service. To create this environment, the Company employs an experienced, well-trained, and highly motivated staff, with interest in building quality client relationships using state-of-the-art delivery systems and client service facilities. The Company&#8217;s executive leadership has extensive banking experience and establishes the Company&#8217;s goal to serve the financial needs of its clients and provide a profitable return to its investors, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The Company focuses on obtaining and retaining customer relationships by offering a broad range of financial services, competitively priced and delivered in a responsive manner, with an emphasis on understanding the financial needs of its customers. Correspondent relationships are utilized where it is cost beneficial. The specific objectives of the Company are: 1) to provide individuals, professionals and local businesses with the highest standard of relationship banking in the local market; 2) to attract deposits and loans by offering state of the art products and services with competitive pricing; 3) to provide a reasonable return to shareholders on capital invested; and 4) to attract, train and retain a happy, motivated and team-oriented group of banking professionals dedicated to meeting the Company&#8217;s objectives. Market &#8220;Niche&#8221; The Company provides the traditional array of commercial banking products and services emphasizing a one-on-one, sit down approach, for the delivery of products and services to consumers and businesses located in Lehigh and Northampton Counties in Pennsylvania. In the Company&#8217;s primary market area, which is dominated by offices of large statewide, regional and interstate banking institutions, as well as non-bank financial service providers (such as credit unions, financial technology companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and mortgage companies), the Company&#8217;s banking services that are furnished in a friendly and courteous manner with a timely response to customer needs fill a &#8220;niche&#8221; that arises due to the continued loss of local institutions through merger and acquisitions. Deposits In order for the Company to attract and retain stable deposit relationships, the Company offers business cash management solution services to help local companies better manage their cash flow. The expertise and experience of the Company&#8217;s management coupled with the latest technology accessed through third party providers enables the Company to maximize the growth of business-related deposits. Embassy Bancorp, Inc. As for consumers, deposit growth is driven by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, population growth, bank and non-bank competition, local bank mergers and consolidations, increase in household income, interest rates, accessibility of location and the sales efforts of Company personnel. Time deposits can be attracted and increased by paying an interest rate higher than that offered by competitors, but are the costliest type of deposit. The most profitable type of deposits are non-interest bearing demand (checking) accounts, which can be attracted by offering free checking. However, both high interest rates and free checking accounts generate certain expenses for a bank and the desire to increase deposits must be balanced with the need to be profitable and the extent of banking relationships with the customers. The deposit services of the Company are generally comprised of demand deposits, savings deposits, money market deposits, time deposits and Individual Retirement Accounts. Loans The loan portfolio of the Company consists primarily of secured fixed and variable rate loans, with a significant concentration in commercial real estate transaction, consumer residential real estate mortgage, and home equity loans. While most credit facilities are appropriately collateralized, major emphasis is placed upon the financial condition of the borrower and evaluating the borrower&#8217;s cash flow versus debt service requirements. The Company has an experienced lending and private banking team. The Company believes that the familiarity of its experienced leadership team and members of the Company&#8217;s Loan Committee, in regard to prospective local borrowers, enables the Company to better evaluate the character, integrity, and creditworthiness of the prospective borrowers. Loan growth is driven by customer demand, which in turn is influenced by individual and business indebtedness and consumer demand for goods. The Company&#8217;s loan and private banking officers call upon accountants, financial planners, attorneys, local realtors, and others to generate loans and loan referrals. Again, a balance between growth, credit risk and pricing are required to maintain performing loans for the Company, as lending money will always entail some risk. A performing loan is a loan which is being repaid according to its original terms and is the most desirable type of loan that a bank seeks to make, to support the generation of enough earnings for a bank to be profitable. The risk involved in each loan must, therefore, be carefully evaluated before the loan is made. The interest rate at which the loan is made should always reflect the risk factors involved, including the term of the loan, the value of collateral, if any, the reliability of the projected source of repayment and the amount of the loan requested. Credit quality will always be the Company&#8217;s most important factor. The Company does not sell its mortgages into the secondary market, has not been involved in any &#8220;sub-prime&#8221; mortgage lending, and has not purchased or invested in any securities backed by or which include sub-prime loans. As further described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2020, as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (&#8220;CARES&#8221;) Act, the Company was approved to be a Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) lender. The Company had not previously been an approved Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) 7(a) lender. The Company participates in the SBA&#8217;s PPP under the CARES Act and subsequent 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act (&#8220;CAA&#8221;). Commercial Lending The Company generally targets businesses with annual revenues of less than $10 million, including business owners, legal, and medical professionals. The Company offers responsiveness, flexibility and local decision making for loan applications of small business owners, thereby eliminating delays caused by non-local management. The Company participates in various local, state, and federal loan programs. Consumer Lending The Company offers its retail customer base a product line of consumer loan services, including mortgage loans, first time home buyer mortgages, secured home equity loans, lines of credit, auto loans, and, to a much lesser extent, unsecured personal loans. &#8206; Embassy Bancorp, Inc. Residential Mortgage Loans The Company offers a range of specialty home equity and mortgage products, including competitively priced first time homeowner loans, which are retained and serviced by the Company. The Company also offers limited mortgage escrow services. The Company seeks to capitalize on its policy of closing loans in a time frame that will meet the needs of its borrowers. Commercial Mortgage\/Construction Loans The Company originates various types of loans secured by real estate, including, to a limited extent, construction loans. Construction loans are generally priced at floating rates tied to current market rates. Upon completion of construction, these loans may be converted into permanent commercial and residential loans. Construction lending is expected to constitute a minor portion of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. In some cases, the Company originates loans larger than its lending limit and enters into participation arrangements for those loans with other banks. As an independent community bank, the Company serves the special needs of legal, medical, accounting, financial service providers and other professionals. Commercial mortgages, lines of credit, term loans and demand loans are tailored to meet the needs of the Company&#8217;s customers in the professional community. In addition to the usual criteria for pricing credit-related products, the Company takes into consideration the overall customer relationship to establish credit pricing. Deposit relationships in demand, savings, money market, and certificate accounts are considered in loan pricing, along with the credit worthiness of the borrower. Other Services To further attract and retain customer relationships, the Company currently provides or expects to provide the standard array of financial services expected of a community bank, which include the following: ACH Origination Credit\/Debit Card Merchant Processing Person to Person Payments ATM and Debit Cards Direct Deposit\/ACH Services Positive Pay Automated Teller Machines Escrow Management Services Remote Deposit Capture Bank by Mail Fraud Detection Services Safe Deposit Boxes Cash Management Services Gift Cards Savings Bond Redemptions Certified Checks Mobile Banking Treasurer Checks Commercial Credit Cards Night Depository Services Wire Transfers Consumer Credit Cards On-Line Banking and Bill Pay Fee Income Fee income is non-interest related. The Company earns fee income by charging customers for banking services, credit card and merchant processing, treasurer&#8217;s checks, overdrafts, wire transfers, check orders, and cash management services, as well as other deposit and loan related fees. Unlike many in the industry, the Company does not sell its mortgages on the secondary market, nor does it offer trust or investment\/brokerage services to its customers, all of which would generate additional fee income. Service\/Market Area The Company is headquartered in Hanover Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania and draws its primary deposits and business from areas immediately surrounding its principal office and its branch offices in South Whitehall Township, Lower Macungie Township, the City of Bethlehem, Salisbury Township, Lower Saucon Township, Lower Nazareth Township, Borough of Nazareth, Borough of Macungie, and Allentown, Pennsylvania, as well as the remainder of Lehigh and Northampton Counties in Pennsylvania. Embassy Bancorp, Inc. According to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) data, as of June 30, 2021, the Company ranks 5 th in bank market share in Northampton County with four (4) offices, and 6 th in Lehigh County bank market share with five (5) offices, with a combined deposit market share of 7.37% for both counties. The Company believes there is significant room for organic growth in its current market area of Lehigh and Northampton Counties. The Company continually evaluates strategic locations for branch offices within the Lehigh Valley, which are supplemented by convenient access through electronic banking products and services, for both consumer and commercial customers. The Company currently has ten (10) offices, with its most recent branch opening at 2002 West Liberty Street, Allentown, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania in September of 2021. Bank Premises The Company currently leases nine (9) of its bank operations premises and leases the land only at the Borough of Macungie branch, with the building being owned by the Company. The ten (10) offices are situated at the following locations: Northampton County: &#61623; Hanover Township (includes administrative offices) &#61623; Lower Saucon Township &#61623; Lower Nazareth Township &#61623; Borough of Nazareth Lehigh County: &#61623; South Whitehall Township &#61623; Salisbury Township &#61623; Lower Macungie Township &#61623; City of Bethlehem &#61623; Borough of Macungie &#61623; City of Allentown The Company pays certain additional expenses of occupying these spaces including, but not necessarily limited to, real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, and repairs. The Company is obligated under the leases to maintain the premises in good order, condition, and repair. Employees As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a total of 106 full-time equivalent employees. Competition The geographic market the Company serves is highly competitive for deposits and loans. The Company competes with local, regional and national traditional banking institutions, as well as non-bank financial service providers such as credit unions, financial technology companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and mortgage companies. In the Company&#8217;s primary market area, major regional and super-regional banks generally hold larger market share positions. By virtue of their larger capital bases, these institutions have significantly larger lending limits, more robust advertising campaigns, significantly larger branch networks, and can invest in technology on a larger scale. The industry, as a whole, competes primarily in the area of interest rates, products offered, customer service and convenience. The Company believes it is able to compete within its market by offering competitive interest rates and a superior level of customer service, as reflected in our continued growth in market share. The Company also continues to capitalize on opportunities created by recent merger announcements, name changes, and competitive branch hour adjustments and\/or closures in the Company&#8217;s market area, attracting customers looking to relocate to a local, reputable community bank. Embassy Bancorp, Inc. Credit unions present a significant competitive challenge to the Company. As credit unions currently enjoy an exemption from income tax, they are able to offer higher deposit rates and lower loan rates than banks can on a comparable basis. Credit unions are also not currently subject to certain regulatory constraints imposed on banks, such as the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;), which require the Company to implement procedures to make and monitor loans throughout the communities served. Adhering to such regulatory requirements raises the Company&#8217;s compliance costs associated with lending activities and reduces potential operating profits. Accordingly, the Company competes by focusing on building customer relationships and maintaining the commitment to customer service the community has come to expect. Segments The Company acts as an independent community financial services provider and offers traditional banking and related financial services to individual, business and government customers. The Company offers a full array of commercial and retail financial services, including the taking of time, savings, and demand deposits; the making of commercial, consumer, residential mortgage, and home equity loans; and the providing of other financial services. Management does not separately allocate expenses, including the cost of funding loan demand, between commercial and retail operations of the Company. As such, discrete financial information is not available and segment reporting would not be meaningful. Seasonality Management does not feel that the deposits, loans, or the business of the Company are generally seasonal in nature. Deposit and loan generation may, however, vary with local and national economic and market conditions, which should not have a material effect on planning and policy making. Supervision and Regulation The Company is subject to extensive regulation under federal and Pennsylvania banking laws, regulations and policies, including prescribed standards relating to capital, earnings, dividends, the repurchase or redemption of shares, loans or extensions of credit to affiliates and insiders, internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, asset growth, impaired assets and loan-to-value ratios. The regulatory framework for banks is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking systems as a whole, and not for the protection of shareholders. The following summary sets forth certain of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries and provides certain specific information about the Company and the Bank. It does not describe all of the provisions of the statutes, regulations and policies that are identified. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by express reference to each of the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on the business of the Company. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act As a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), which became law on July 21, 2010, there is additional regulatory oversight and supervision of the Company and the Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry, and includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that affect the regulation of community banks and bank holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposed new capital requirements on bank holding companies; changed the base for FDIC insurance assessments to a bank&#8217;s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, rather than upon its deposit base; permanently raised the current standard deposit insurance limit to $250,000; and expanded the FDIC&#8217;s authority to raise insurance premiums. Embassy Bancorp, Inc. The Dodd-Frank Act also includes provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation at all publicly traded companies and allows financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts. The legislation also restricts proprietary trading, places restrictions on the owning or sponsoring of hedge and private equity funds, and regulates the derivatives activities of banks and their affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes the Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify threats to the financial stability of the U.S., promote market discipline, and respond to emerging threats to the stability of the U.S. financial system. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Through the Dodd-Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;) was established as an independent entity within the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;). The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans, and credit cards. The CFPB&#8217;s rules contain provisions on mortgage-related matters such as steering incentives, and determinations as to a borrower&#8217;s ability to repay, loan servicing, and prepayment penalties. On January 10, 2013, the CFPB issued a final regulation defining a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; for purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act and setting standards for mortgage lenders to determine whether a consumer has the ability to repay the mortgage. This regulation, which became effective on January 10, 2014, also affords safe harbor legal protections for lenders making qualified loans that are not &#8220;higher priced.&#8221; On January 17, 2013, the CFPB issued a final regulation containing new mortgage servicing rules applicable to our bank subsidiary, which took effect on January 10, 2014. The announced goal of the CFPB is to bring greater consumer protection to the mortgage servicing market. These changes affect notices to be given to consumers in reference to delinquency, foreclosure alternatives, modification applications, interest rate adjustments and options for avoiding &#8220;force-placed&#8221; insurance. Servicers are also prohibited from processing foreclosures when a loan modification is pending and must wait until a loan is more than 120 days delinquent before initiating a foreclosure action. Additionally, the servicer must provide direct and ongoing access to its personnel and provide prompt review of any loss mitigation application. Servicers must maintain accurate and accessible mortgage records for the life of a loan and until one year after the loan is paid off or transferred. Capital Standards In July 2013, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board approved final rules substantially amending the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The final rule implements the &#8220;Basel III&#8221; regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for the Bank and the Company on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes &#8220;capital&#8221; for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also established a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; of 2.5%, that effectively results in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement was fully implemented as of January 2019 for the Company. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions. In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the federal banking regulators established minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) guidelines for bank holding companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3% for those bank holding companies which have the highest regulatory examination ratings and are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth or expansion. All other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4%. Embassy Bancorp, Inc. The capital ratios to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under current capital rules are: common equity of 6.5%, Tier 1 leverage of 5%, Tier 1 risk-based capital of 8%, and Total Risk-Based capital of 10%. Effective in the third quarter of 2018, the Federal Reserve raised the consolidated asset limit to be considered a small bank holding company from $1 billion to $3 billion. A company that qualifies as a small bank holding company is not subject to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s consolidated capital rules, although a company that so qualifies may continue to file reports that include such capital amounts and ratios. The Company voluntarily elected to continue to report those amounts and ratios. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company qualified as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under the foregoing regulatory capital standards and exceeded the capital conservation buffers. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Capital Adequacy and Operations Enacted in 1991, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;) contains provisions limiting activities and business methods of depository institutions. FDICIA required the primary federal banking regulators to promulgate regulations setting forth standards relating to, among other things, internal controls, and audit systems; credit underwriting and loan documentation; interest rate exposure and other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities; and compensation of directors and officers. FDICIA also provided for expanded regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates, including parent holding companies, by such institutions&#8217; primary federal banking regulator. Each primary federal banking regulator is required to specify, by regulation, capital standards for measuring the capital adequacy of the depository institutions it supervises and, depending upon the extent to which a depository institution does not meet such capital adequacy measures, the primary federal banking regulator may prohibit such institution from paying dividends or may require such institution to take other steps to become adequately capitalized. FDICIA established five capital tiers, ranging from &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; to &#8220;critically under-capitalized&#8221;. A depository institution is well capitalized if it significantly exceeds the minimum level required by regulation for each relevant capital measure. Under FDICIA, an institution that is not well capitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market; in addition, &#8220;pass through&#8221; insurance coverage may not be available for certain employee benefit accounts. FDICIA also requires an undercapitalized depository institution to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency. One requisite element of such a plan is that the institution&#8217;s parent holding company must guarantee compliance by the institution with the plan, subject to certain limitations. In the event of the parent holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, the guarantee, and any other commitments that the parent holding company has made to federal bank regulators to maintain the capital of its depository institution subsidiaries, would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority in payment. At December 31, 2021, the Bank qualified as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under these regulatory capital standards. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included at Item 8 of this Report. Federal Deposit Insurance (&#8220;FDI&#8221;) Act and Part 363 of the FDIC Regulations Section 36 of the FDI Act and Part 363 of the FDIC&#39;s regulations require insured depository institutions with at least $500 million in total assets to file a Part 363 Annual Report with the applicable bank regulatory agencies, which, among other things, requires that the Company establish and maintain an effective internal control structure over financial reporting and provide an assessment by management of the institution&#39;s compliance with the designated laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and dividend restrictions. Bank Holding Company Regulation As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the &#8220;Pennsylvania Department of Banking&#8221;) and the Federal Reserve Board. The Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board an annual report and such additional information as the Embassy Bancorp, Inc. Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;). The BHC Act requires each bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire substantially all the assets of any bank, or before it may acquire ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than five percent of the voting shares of such bank. Such a transaction may also require approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking. Pennsylvania law permits Pennsylvania bank holding companies to control an unlimited number of banks. Pursuant to the BHC Act and regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board thereunder, the Company may only engage in or own companies that engage in activities deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto, and the holding company must obtain permission from the Federal Reserve Board prior to engaging in most new business activities. A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the BHC Act on any extensions of credit to the bank or any of its subsidiaries, investments in the stock or securities thereof, and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are also prevented from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of services. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve Board regulations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks, a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company&#8217;s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve Board to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve Board regulations or both. This doctrine is commonly known as the &#8220;source of strength&#8221; doctrine. Regulation of Embassy Bank for the Lehigh Valley Embassy Bank for the Lehigh Valley is a Pennsylvania-chartered banking institution and is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and the FDIC. Federal and state banking laws and regulations govern, among other things, the scope of a bank&#8217;s business, the investments a bank may make, the reserves against deposits a bank must maintain, the loans a bank makes and collateral it takes, the maximum interest rates a bank may pay on deposits, the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and consolidations, the establishment of branches, and management practices and other aspects of banking operations. Dividend Restrictions The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Declaration and payment of cash dividends depends upon cash dividend payments to the Company by the Bank, which is the Company&#8217;s primary source of revenue and cash flow. Accordingly, the right of the Company, and consequently the right of our creditors and shareholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of the Company in its capacity as a creditor may be recognized. As a Pennsylvania chartered bank, the Bank is subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment and amounts of dividends under the Pennsylvania Banking Code. Further, the ability of banking subsidiaries to pay dividends is also subject to their profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 8 of this Report. The payment of dividends by the Bank and the Company may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution&#8217;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under FDICIA, a depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause Embassy Bancorp, Inc. it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying a dividend if the regulators deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice. Community Reinvestment Act The Company&#8217;s Directors and Officers are committed to reaching out to the community in which they live and work. The personal, business and community rewards for helping local residents and businesses are numerous. The Board is dedicated to recognizing an ongoing commitment and understanding of the Company&#8217;s responsibility under the CRA. The Company is committed to providing access to credit and deposit products for all members of the communities that it serves. The Company is currently undergoing an FDIC CRA examination. The Company had its last CRA examination in 2018 and received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating. Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders The Bank also is subject to the restrictions of Sections 23A, 23B, 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. Section 23A requires that loans or extensions of credit to an affiliate, purchases of securities issued by an affiliate, purchases of assets from an affiliate (except as may be exempted by order or regulation), the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral and the issuance of a guarantee or acceptance of letters of credit on behalf of an affiliate (collectively, &#8220;Covered Transactions&#8221;) be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Section 23A also imposes quantitative restrictions on the amount of and collateralization requirements on such transactions. Section 23B requires that all Covered Transactions and certain other transactions, including the sale of securities or other assets to an affiliate and the payment of money or the furnishing of services to an affiliate, be on terms comparable to those prevailing for similar transactions with non-affiliates. Section 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act impose similar limitations on loans and extensions of credit from the Bank to its executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders and any of their related interests. The limitations restrict the terms and aggregate amount of such transactions. Regulation O implements the provisions of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) and requires maintenance of records of such transactions by the Bank and regular reporting of such transactions by insiders. The FDIC also requires the Bank, upon request, to disclose publicly loans and extensions of credit to insiders in excess of certain amounts. Deposit Insurance and Premiums As a FDIC member institution, the Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured to the maximum of $250,000 per depositor through the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) that is administered by the FDIC and each institution is required to pay quarterly deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. Other Federal Laws and Regulations State usury and credit laws limit the amount of interest and various other charges collected or contracted by a bank on loans. The Bank&#8217;s loans are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the following: &#61623; Federal Truth-In-Lending Act, which governs disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; &#61623; Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligations to meet the housing needs of the community it serves; &#61623; Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed, or other prohibitive factors in extending credit; Embassy Bancorp, Inc. &#61623; Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which requires lenders to disclose certain information regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements, and prohibits certain lending practices, as well as limits escrow account amounts in real estate transactions; &#61623; Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and &#61623; Various rules and regulations of various federal agencies charged with the implementation of such federal laws. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s operations are subject to additional federal laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions, including, without limitation: &#61623; Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related regulations, which require the Company to maintain privacy policies intended to safeguard customer financial information, to disclose the policies to the Company&#8217;s customers and to allow customers to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of having their financial service providers disclose their confidential financial information to non-affiliated third parties, subject to certain exceptions; &#61623; Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; &#61623; Consumer protection rules for the sale of insurance products by depository institutions, adopted pursuant to the requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; and &#61623; USA Patriot Act, which requires financial institutions to take certain actions to help prevent, detect, and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represented a comprehensive revision of laws affecting corporate governance, accounting obligations and corporate reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is applicable to all companies with equity securities registered or that file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including publicly held bank holding companies such as the Company. In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act establishes: (i) requirements for audit committees, including independence, expertise, and responsibilities; (ii) additional responsibilities regarding financial statements for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the reporting company; (iii) standards for a uditors and regulation of audits; (iv) increased disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and its directors and executive officers; and (v) new and increased civil and criminal penalties for violations of the securities laws. Governmental Policies The Company&#8217;s earnings are significantly affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open-market operations in U.S. Government securities and federal funds, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing s and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments and deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits. The Federal Reserve Board frequently uses these instruments of monetary policy, especially its open-market operations and the discount rate, to influence the level of interest rates and to affect the strength of the economy, the level of inflation or the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of banking institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. It is not possible to predict the nature of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies, or the effect which they may have on the Company&#8217;s business and earnings. Other Legislative Initiatives Proposals may be introduced in the United States Congress and in the Pennsylvania Legislature and before various bank regulatory authorities, which would alter the powers of, and restrictions on, different types of banking organizations and which would restructure part or all of the existing regulatory framework for banks, bank holding companies and other providers of financial services. Moreover, other bills may be introduced in Congress which Embassy Bancorp, Inc. would further regulate, deregulate, or restructure the financial services industry, including proposals to substantially reform the regulatory framework. It is not possible to predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted into law or, even if enacted, the effect which they may have on the Company&#8217;s business and earnings. Human Capital Management We believe that outstanding people are the key to the Company&#8217;s growth and success. Through the efforts of our team, Embassy has established itself as a leading organization in our Lehigh Valley community. The Company&#8217;s philosophy is to strive to maintain simplicity in our policies and efficiency in our procedures. We pride ourselves in creating an open, diverse, and transparent culture that celebrates teamwork and recognizes team members at all levels. We believe that diversity of cultures, thoughts, and experiences results in better outcomes and empowers our team members to make more meaningful contributions within our company and community. This in turn provides an environment in which our team will thrive. The majority of our team are regular full-time employees, and we also employ regular part-time employees and some seasonal\/temporary team members. It is by design that the Company runs a very efficient operation, relying greatly on the knowledge and experience of its leadership team, and, where appropriate, the outsourcing of certain functions to high quality vendors, in order to do so. This level of efficiency requires that individual members of the Company&#8217;s leadership team assume roles that are most often held by multiple individuals at banks within the Company&#8217;s peer group. For example, David M. Lobach, Jr. serves as Chairman of the Board, as well as President and Chief Executive Officer, Judith A. Hunsicker serves as Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, James R. Bartholomew serves as Senior Lending Officer and oversees business banking and business development, Diane M. Cunningham oversees retail banking and consumer lending, as well as marketing, and Lynne M. Neel oversees the finance department, deposit and loan operations and investor relations, to name a few such examples. This multidisciplinary approach is replicated throughout the Company. The Company has created a group consisting of team members called the &#8220;Culture Club.&#8221; The club is designed to keep our business culture in the forefront of all we do. This team provides new employees with their first look at the unique Embassy culture through an orientation program created with the individual in mind. In addition, the team actively works on creative activities and educational events to enhance our existing culture for the entire Embassy team. Our culture is truly defined by &#8220;us.&#8221; The Company family is made up of a diverse group of professionals who share the common goal of making our bank succeed by providing superior customer service through sales, education, technology, and teamwork. Our experience has shown that when employees communicate openly and directly with supervisors, the work environment can be excellent, expectations can be clear, and attitudes will be positive. We believe that the Company amply demonstrates its commitment to employees by responding effectively to employee concerns. Annually, every team member is asked to complete a team member commitment form, in which he or she describes duties and responsibilities they may face in their day to day work. The Company maintains these forms and uses them to aid in orienting new employees to their jobs, identifying the requirements of each position, balancing responsibilities amongst the team, establishing hiring criteria, setting standards for employee performance evaluations, and establishing a basis for making reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities. They are also used for discussion in connection with an existing employee&#8217;s review process. Supervisors and employees are strongly encouraged to discuss job performance and goals on an informal, day-to-day basis. Employees are asked to annually participate in the Company&#39;s self-assessment process, which includes their Personal Team Member Commitment (which describes positions) and Personal Balance Sheet. Additionally, this Balance Sheet is a formal performance evaluation conducted to provide both supervisors and employees the opportunity to discuss job tasks, identify and correct weaknesses, encourage and recognize strengths, and discuss positive, purposeful approaches for efficiently carrying out the responsibility of each position. The salary and benefits program at the Company was created to achieve consistent pay practices, comply with federal and state laws, mirror our commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity, and offer competitive salaries and benefits within our labor market. Because recruiting and retaining talented and diverse employees is critical to our success, the Company is committed to paying its team members equitable wages that reflect the requirements and responsibilities of their positions and are competitive with the pay received by similarly situated employees in other banks in the area. Embassy Bancorp, Inc. Compensation for every position is determined by several factors, including the essential duties and responsibilities of the job, and knowledge of pay practices of other employers. The Company periodically reviews its salary and benefits program and restructures it as necessary. Eligible employees at the Company are provided a wide range of benefits. A number of the programs (such as Social Security, workers&#39; compensation, state disability, and unemployment insurance) cover all employees in the manner prescribed by law. Benefits eligibility is dependent upon a variety of factors, primarily whether the employee is full time or part time. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) as a global pandemic and on March 13, 2020 the United States government declared COVID-19 as a national emergency. Specific to COVID-19, the Company&#8217;s top priority is the health and safety of our team, customers, vendors, and the public. Embassy Bank&#8217;s Pandemic Officer is responsible for the oversight of the Company&#8217;s COVID-19 Program. The COVID-19 Plan Guidance has been distributed to all employees, and when necessary, to on-site workers, and vendors. All team members, onsite workers, visitors, vendors, and customers must comply with local, state, and federal government regulations regarding COVID-19 policies and personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements. The Company has followed, and intends to continue to follow, at minimum, the most recent guidance issued by the Center for Disease Control (&#8220;CDC&#8221;) and the Pennsylvania Department of Health.

","11":" Item 1. Business.&#160; Overview &#160;We are a blank check company, incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination (the &#8220;Business Combination&#8221;) with one or more businesses. We have not yet selected any specific Business Combination target. We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of our Private Placement Warrants (as defined below), our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt.&#160;We currently intend to concentrate our efforts identifying those businesses engaged with emerging and transformational technologies, focusing particularly on businesses operating within (1) space, defense and communications and (2) advanced air mobility and logistics industries, or the target industries. New and emerging technologies are driving vital changes across these industries, and we believe these developments will continue to accelerate over the next several years. We believe that our broad industry focus will provide for many potential targets that could become attractive public companies as well as allow us to explore potential targets with a diverse set of business models and financial characteristics, including those that range from high-growth, early-stage innovators to more mature businesses with established franchises, revenue streams and cash flows.&#160;We are seeking to invest in a business or businesses where we believe our management team can increase shareholder value and deliver attractive investor returns. We plan to seek a target with a strong, defensible market position and robust growth prospects that will benefit from our involvement. We also believe that the New Vista team (as defined below) can recruit additional talent to strengthen our capabilities and expertise further as we pursue an initial Business Combination. We also believe that we can help target businesses attract additional talent and drive financial, operational, strategic and managerial improvements in order to significantly increase value. We will primarily examine companies that exhibit the potential to significantly change the industries in which they operate and offer the potential for sustained levels of growth. While we will seek to pursue an initial Business Combination within our target industries, we are not required to do so and may pursue an initial Business Combination outside of these industries.&#160;Our sponsor, New Vista Acquisition Sponsor LLC (the &#8220;Sponsor&#8221;), is a Delaware limited liability company and its managing members are Dennis Muilenburg, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Kirsten Bartok Touw, our Co-President and Chief Operating Officer and Travis Nelson, our Co-President and Chief Financial Officer.&#160;Our registration statement for our initial public offering (&#8220;Initial Public Offering&#8221;) was declared effective on February 16, 2021. On February 19, 2021, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 27,600,000 units, including the issuance of 3,600,000 units as a result of the underwriters&#8217; full exercise of their over-allotment option (the &#8220;Units&#8221; and, with respect to the ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the &#8220;Public Shares&#8221;), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $276,000,000. Each Unit consisted of one Public Share and one-third of one redeemable Warrant (the &#8220;Public Warrants&#8221;). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Public Share for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment.&#160;Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated a private placement (the &#8220;Private Placement&#8221;) of 5,680,000 Warrants (the &#8220;Private Placement Warrants,&#8221; and together with the Public Warrants, the &#8220;Warrants&#8221;) at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $8,520,000. Transaction costs amounted to $15,699,812, consisting of $5,520,000 of underwriting discount, $9,660,000 of deferred underwriting discount, and $519,812 of other offering costs.&#160;&#160;&#160;Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on February 19, 2021, $276,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a Trust Account (the &#8220;Trust Account&#8221;), which is invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;). The proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (1) the completion of an initial Business Combination; (2) the redemption of any Public Shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with the initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of the our Public Shares if we do not complete the initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the &#8220;Combination Period&#8221;) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders&#8217; rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity; and (3) the redemption of our Public Shares if we have not completed an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, subject to applicable law.&#160;We must complete our initial Business Combination with one or more operating businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, we will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully.&#160;We have not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from December 21, 2020 (inception) through March 31, 2022 relates to the Company&#8217;s formation and the Initial Public Offering, and, since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and marketable securities from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering and will recognize changes in the fair value of Warrant liability as other income (expense).&#160;We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) without a shareholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public shareholders will be entitled to redeem their shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, including interest, divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations.&#160;We have 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to complete the initial Business Combination. However, if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders&#8217; rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to the Company&#8217;s obligations under Cayman Islands law, to provide for claims of creditors and to comply with the requirements of any other applicable law.&#160; &#160;&#160; Effecting a Business Combination &#160; Our Business Strategy &#160;While we may pursue an initial Business Combination in any industry, we intend to identify and acquire an emerging technology business operating in two broadly defined market areas: (i) space, defense and communications and (ii) advanced air mobility and logistics. We believe the New Vista team has distinguished experience with and insights into how emerging technologies will impact growth and capital appreciation in our target industries, and is thus advantageously positioned to execute on a transaction within them&#160;Emerging Technologies &#160; In recent years, technology has taken on an increasingly important role in our society and has rendered long-standing customs and practices obsolete at an unprecedented pace. As a result, new markets have been created and legacy businesses have been required to adapt, paving the way for the new opportunities on which the New Vista team seeks to capitalize. Moreover, as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic and the corresponding response of private and public sector organizations as well as a shift in societal and economic behaviors, these changes have further accelerated. We believe the economic recovery cycle and post-pandemic renewal should provide ample opportunity for our company.&#160;Emerging technologies we have identified include, but are not limited to, electric, hybrid and distributed propulsion, alternative fuel, power and power storage systems, advanced materials and manufacturing technologies, digital networks and advanced computing, sensor and situational awareness systems, robotics and automation, software-driven data processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence (&#8220;AI&#8221;). These technologies have already begun to change the industry sectors we target, and yet many of these technologies remain in early stages of development. We believe this presents a significant opportunity to invest in and develop technologies such as these, whose applications are not yet fully known and likely to expand amid future technological advancements and ever-evolving needs.&#160;Transformational technologies are being incorporated into many of the products and services within our target industries. As a result, we have witnessed a number of trends such as electrification, automation and digitization redefining these markets and their competitive dynamics. These technologies are enabling both new and existing systems to become more reliable, secure and cost-effective. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need for new solutions in response to changes in the ways in which we work, educate and communicate.&#160;For example, the pandemic has accelerated the need for companies to cut costs, adapt to a more distributed workforce (as well as implement the necessary infrastructure to support it) and provide safer and more convenient methods to distribute goods and services to an increasingly dispersed marketplace. We expect that changing workforce demographics will also accelerate a shift in travel dynamics, increasing the need for more efficient modes of short-range transportation, such as those potentially achievable through advanced air mobility as well as enhanced electric, hybrid and autonomous flight technologies.&#160;With increased adoption of technological solutions across both the public and private sectors, we believe changing needs and demographics will be a focal point for major changes in our target industries by giving new entrants a distinct competitive advantage and providing legacy enterprises with new tools to adapt and modernize. Furthermore, we believe that companies engaged in the development and application of new and emerging technologies will benefit from continued growth in both overall market size and penetration.&#160;In evaluating potential targets for our initial Business Combination, we believe that key business characteristics include:&#160;&#9679; Significant investment in and development of new technologies, creating competitive differentiation and high barriers to entry. &#160;&#9679; Targeting high-growth segments within large, attractive end-markets. &#160;&#9679; Outsized, sustained growth opportunity. &#160;&#9679; Strong management team with a clear vision of the future and ability to execute on this vision. &#160;&#9679; Well-positioned to benefit from access to public equity markets with highly attractive uses of additional capital investment. &#160; &#160;&#160; Space, Defense and Communications &#160;In the space, defense and communications sectors, lower cost and reliable access to space has improved and enabled new methods of data collection, communication and information sharing. Consistent with the space economy&#8217;s growth over the last 10 years, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as of 2020 estimates that the industry will grow at a CAGR of approximately 6% over the next two decades, bringing global revenues from approximately $420 billion in 2019 to $1.5 trillion by 2040. Similar growth prospects exist in the defense sector, as the defense industrial base is a critical infrastructure industry which has received increased attention and funding in recent years. As of 2020, market reports estimate that global defense spending will grow by nearly 3% per annum and exceed $2 trillion in 2021.&#160;Near-peer threats and the emergence of high-tech warfare and the digital battlefield have led governments to make substantial investments to develop and expand mission-critical capabilities. Prevailing sentiment from the DoD is that space is the next warfighting domain, creating an accelerated funding backdrop for defense spending on space infrastructure and missile defense capabilities. Hardened and low-latency military networks are made possible by emerging technologies in laser-based communications via next-generation micro and cube satellites.&#160;We believe new opportunities are emerging that blur the lines between the government and commercial sectors. Many high-profile players have begun to make investments in large-scale space and defense infrastructure projects. Governments across the globe have renewed their interest in space development and exploration, and their push is often coupled with an emphasis on supporting and utilizing commercial technology. In the United States, the Space Development Agency is planning to utilize commercial technology for thousands of Low Earth Orbit satellites in support of the National Defense Space Architecture. Additionally, commercial providers of internet, imagery and other services have applied to launch a total of over 50,000 small satellites in the next decade as they seek to secure market share in the New Space economy. Further, the United States continues to maintain the largest defense budget globally with $740 billion budgeted in 2021, having grown an average of 4% annually since 2015.&#160;Innovation in the defense sector is becoming increasingly important. While spending has remained robust, near-peer adversaries have outpaced the United States&#8217; technological development in areas critical to national security including hypersonics and directed energy. In parallel, the legacy cycles of innovation across the U.S. defense industrial base have become heavily impacted by bureaucracy which seems to favor past practices over those that are novel and contribute to the technological deficit. We believe many companies in this sector are facing significant hurdles as they remain in the critical stages between a product&#8217;s development and wide-spread adoption through a program of record. The DoD is using new funding strategies such as Other Transaction Authorities to allow new, innovative companies to overcome this hurdle and bring critical technologies to bear through accelerated prototyping.&#160;The increase in the accessibility of space and communications through lower launch costs and miniaturization has given rise to an expanding group of start-up technology companies that aim to serve diverse end-markets spanning national security, agriculture, energy, geospatial, shipping, tourism and IoT connectivity, among others. These companies are kindling the development and commercialization of ancillary industries, technologies and sciences that until recently did not exist. Further, we believe accelerated advancements in manufacturing technology, including additive manufacturing processes, are significantly changing the design and build processes of satellites and launch vehicles. We believe we are still in the early stages of this transformation with only a fraction of needs understood or even addressed, creating opportunities for investors. Further, we believe the government&#8217;s emphasis on nurturing and supporting commercial providers of space, defense and communication products and services presents attractive opportunities for investors on which the New Vista team is well-positioned to capitalize and address.&#160; Advanced Air Mobility and Logistics &#160;We believe the advanced air mobility and logistics industries are poised to experience significant changes over the next decade amidst accelerating developments of core technologies as well as the introduction of new ones. With the distinct challenges in the transportation sector and significant stresses put on global supply chains as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe the potential for emerging technologies to change these sectors is now clearer. Recent growth in E-Commerce has accelerated demand for logistics providers. The U.S. Department of Transportation projects that freight movement will grow from 18 billion tons in 2015 to 25 billion tons in 2045, showcasing the need for drastic improvements in the efficiency of the current infrastructure. In addition, between global population growth and continued rural to urban migrations, the United Nations expects 70% of the global population to be in urban areas by 2050, which means an additional 2.5 billion people added to our already densely populated urban areas. Additionally, new modes of regional and urban travel are beginning to emerge, with expectations for a more than $1.5 trillion urban air mobility market over the next two decades, driven by efforts to reduce congestion, gain time efficiency and advance sustainability. We believe that some of the emerging technologies that will drive these changes will depend on a combination of both software and hardware, and that some of the most compelling opportunities for investors will exist at the intersection of multiple technologies as they help to ameliorate key industry issues, including high costs, low utilization, environmental concerns and pricing opacity.&#160;&#160;&#160;We expect primary drivers of change to include advancements in power systems (including improved battery technology and more efficient hydrogen fuel cells that drive electrification) and composite technologies that help to increase component durability, reduce operating costs and support electrification efforts. Due to the capital-intensive nature of these types of businesses and the complex regulatory environment surrounding our target industries, the ability to access capital will be essential to their growth. Once technological proof-of-concept has been established, we believe these types of companies will be well-suited to the public markets as they transition focus toward commercialization, manufacturing, sales and scale.&#160;We expect advances in machine learning and AI to transcend numerous aspects of our target industries and many more beyond them. These technologies have the potential to reduce operating costs, increase efficiency, improve workplace safety and change the roles that humans play in their workplaces. We see particularly relevant applications for these technologies as they apply to increasing autonomy &#8211; ranging from freight and passenger transit (i.e., self-driving vehicles, drone deliveries and advanced air mobility) to route scheduling and optimization to warehousing and inventory management. For example, as of 2020, in the United States, approximately 25% of truck miles are driven empty, and loaded truck utilization is hovering around 55%, indicating substantial opportunities for optimization. Some of these might include leveraging data and predictive analytics to collect and employ data from fleet operations, vehicle diagnostics and the state of essential infrastructure to automate scheduling and optimize route, volume and maintenance planning, increasing fleet utilization while decreasing deadhead capacity and unexpected equipment malfunctions. Additionally, we expect the advent of digital freight platforms that directly connect shippers with carriers in a dispersed marketplace to create value for both parties to significantly change existing marketplace dynamics across multiple modes of transit.&#160; Our Acquisition Criteria &#160;We intend to search for Business Combination opportunities where our management team would be distinctly positioned to add value. We will use the following criteria as guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet some or all of these criteria, which are not meant to be exhaustive. However, we intend to seek to acquire companies that we believe:&#160;&#9679; Have significant investments in and development of new technologies, creating competitive differentiation and high barriers to entry &#160;&#9679; Target high-growth segments within large, attractive end-markets &#160;&#9679; Have outsized, sustained growth opportunities &#160;&#9679; Have strong management team with a clear vision of the future and ability to execute on that vision &#160;&#9679; Are well-positioned to benefit from access to public equity markets with highly attractive uses of additional capital investment &#160;Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial Business Combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, and criteria that our management team and advisors may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose as such in our shareholder communications related to our initial Business Combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.&#160; &#160;&#160; Additional Disclosures &#160; Our Acquisition Process &#160;Our directors and officers presently have, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a Business Combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our directors or officers becomes aware of a Business Combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may need to honor these fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such Business Combination opportunity to such entity, or in the case of a non-compete restriction, may not present such opportunity to us at all, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Our directors and officers are also not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential Business Combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.&#160;We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers will materially affect our ability to identify and pursue Business Combination opportunities or complete our initial Business Combination. Our directors and officers are also not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential Business Combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Relating to Management Team &#8212; Certain of our directors and officers are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.&#8221;&#160;Past experience or performance of our management team and our Sponsor&#8217;s advisors and their respective affiliates is not a guarantee of either (1) our ability to successfully identify and execute a transaction or (2) success with respect to any Business Combination that we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team or our Sponsor&#8217;s advisors or their respective affiliates as indicative of future performance. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Past performance by our management team and our Sponsor&#8217;s advisors and their respective affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in the company.&#8221; No member of our management team has any experience operating a special purpose acquisition company.&#160;Our Sponsor&#8217;s advisors are not under any obligation to source any potential opportunities for our initial Business Combination or refer any such opportunities to our company or provide any other services for our company. Such advisors&#8217; roles with respect to our company is expected to be primarily passive and advisory in nature. Our Sponsor&#8217;s advisors may have fiduciary and\/or contractual duties to certain companies but do not have any fiduciary obligations to our company. As a result, our Sponsor&#8217;s advisors may have a duty to offer Business Combination opportunities to certain other companies before our company. Additionally, certain companies affiliated with our Sponsor&#8217;s advisors may enter into transactions with, provide goods or services to, or receive goods or services from an entity with which we seek to complete our initial Business Combination. Transactions of these types may present a conflict of interest because our Sponsor&#8217;s advisors may directly or indirectly receive a financial benefit as a result of such transaction. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Relating to our Management Team &#8212; Our Sponsor&#8217;s advisors are not under any obligation to source any potential opportunities for our initial Business Combination or refer any such opportunities to our company or provide any other services for our company.&#8221;&#160; Initial Business Combination &#160;The Nasdaq listing rules require that our initial Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into our initial Business Combination. We refer to this as the 80% of fair market value test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial Business Combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case.&#160;&#160;&#160;We anticipate structuring our initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target business or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial Business Combination. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of fair market value test. If our initial Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of fair market value test.&#160; Competition &#160;We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Additionally, the number of blank check companies looking for business combination targets has increased compared to recent years, and many of these blank check companies are sponsored by entities or persons that have significant experience with completing business combinations. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, in the event we seek shareholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we are obligated to pay cash for our Class A ordinary shares, it will potentially reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a Business Combination.&#160; Human Capital Management &#160;We currently have three officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial Business Combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial Business Combination and the current stage of the Business Combination process.&#160;&#160;&#160;","12":" Item 1. BUSINESSGeneralUDR is a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, disposes of, and manages multifamily apartment communities in targeted markets located in the United States. At December 31, 2021, our consolidated real estate portfolio consisted of 160 communities located in 21 markets, consisting of 53,229 completed apartment homes, which are held directly or through our subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership, and consolidated joint ventures. In addition, we have an ownership interest in 6,570 completed or to-be-completed apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships, including 3,733 apartment homes owned by entities in which we hold preferred equity investments. At December 31, 2021, the Company was developing five wholly-owned communities totaling 1,417 homes, none of which have been completed.UDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this Report as the &#8220;Code.&#8221; To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually. In 2021, we declared total distributions of $1.45 per common share and paid dividends of $1.4475 per common share.&#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Dividends &#160; Dividends &#8203; &#8203; Declared in &#8203; Paid in &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; First Quarter&#8203; $0.3625 &#8203; $0.3600 Second Quarter&#8203; &#160;0.3625 &#8203; &#160;0.3625 Third Quarter&#8203; &#160;0.3625 &#8203; &#160;0.3625 Fourth Quarter&#8203; &#160;0.3625 &#8203; &#160;0.3625 Total&#8203; $1.4500 &#8203; $1.4475 &#8203; UDR was formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation.

The consolidated financial statements of UDR include the noncontrolling interests of the unitholders in the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership.Human Capital Management &#8203; As of February 11, 2022, we had 1,219 full-time associates and 10 part-time associates, all of whom were employed by UDR. Of such number 815 associates are employed in roles that are located at or that are solely related to our communities and the remainder are employed in corporate roles. Recruiting and retaining our associates, as well as assisting them in their professional development, are critically important in successfully managing our business. UDR&#8217;s culture is one based on innovation, inclusion, empowerment, adaptability, and execution, and understanding and maintaining our culture is fundamental to recruiting and retaining associates. To that end, in 2020 we updated our culture statement and launched an associate facing culture website to ensure that our associates understand our culture and have an opportunity to participate in its evolution.&#8203; Associate Compensation &#8203; Attracting, developing, and retaining high-quality and diverse associates are critical to the long-term success of our Company. Implementing fair, non-biased compensation practices is our starting point. We also use various recruiting methods depending on job function, including an associate referral program, internet-based recruiting platforms, and third-party recruiting agencies. With respect to compensation, we utilize market surveys and other third-party information when determining salary ranges, and we design our compensation programs to include bonus potential to incentivize performance. In addition, we evaluate gender- and diversity-based job-title-specific compensation metrics quarterly to actively monitor pay equity, identify areas for improvement and as part of the Company&#8217;s on-going Next Generation Platform implementation. These results are provided annually to our Board of Directors.&#8203; Associate Growth and Development &#8203; We believe that training is important to our associates&#8217; job satisfaction, is essential to furthering their effectiveness, and helps in career advancement and associate retention, helping us to create a more efficient workforce. Accordingly, we offer a wide variety of training opportunities. In addition to training designed to address regulatory and statutory matters (e.g., harassment, cybersecurity, fair housing, etc.), associates have the option of participating in management development through our Certified Manager and Career Mobility Programs. These programs are designed to enable our associates to acquire skills that will be useful to them as they progress in their career. In total, there are over 5,000 courses available to our associates. Examples of program topics include: leasing skills, basic property maintenance, customer service, project management, and system applications. In aggregate, our associates engaged in 24,422 hours of training in 2021, or an average of 20 hours per associate. In addition, we enhanced our controls around required training to ensure that associates complete these courses in a timely manner. As of our 2021 year end measurement, 91% of associates completed annual technology IT security training, 99% of associates completed fair housing training, 96% of associates completed annual harassment training, 97% of associates completed diversity and inclusion training, and 95% of associates completed our annual business ethics training. &#8203; Certifications are important in the apartment business, and we encourage our associates to become professionally certified in areas that interest them and are beneficial to the Company. Certifications range from master&#8217;s degree programs to certified property manager programs, to technical licenses for HVAC systems, all of which equip our associates with knowledge and the potential for career-expansion opportunities. UDR offers partial tuition reimbursement related to attaining these certifications.&#8203; Each UDR associate is required to engage in an annual performance review with their direct supervisor. Among other things, the performance review establishes the associate&#8217;s training plans for the upcoming year and provides feedback on career development for each associate.&#8203; In addition, we monitor associate turnover and take action when issues are identified if appropriate.&#8203; Diversity and Inclusion &#8203; We are committed to creating and maintaining a diverse and inclusive workplace environment that supports the development and advancement of all associates.&#8203; As of December 31, 2021, our total workforce is 59% male and 41% female. The ethnicity of our workforce is 56% White, 26% Hispanic\/Latino, 10% Black, 3% Asian and 5% Other. &#8220;Other&#8221; includes: American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, Not Specified or two or more races.&#8203; As of December 31, 2021, our management team (associates with the title of community director or director and higher job classifications) is 53% male and 47% female. The ethnicity of our management team is 80% White and 20% non-White. &#8203; Over the three-year period ending December 31, 2021, 642 associates were promoted. Of the associates that were promoted to the positions of community director, director, or a higher job classification during the period, 51% were female and 22% were non-White.&#8203; Associate Engagement and Outreach &#8203; We conduct an associate engagement survey every two to three years, which surveys all associates on a variety of issues. The results of our 2021 survey showed that 94% of associates feel that they can build relationships with colleagues, 89% of associates feel that they are treated fairly and 87% of associates feel that they can succeed and thrive at work. We believe that our associates should also be involved in their communities and that we should assist with those efforts. In 2019, UDR provided 2,558 hours of paid time off for our associates to be used for volunteer work with more than 25 local organizations that make a difference in the communities in which we operate. UDR provides paid time off during specified, Company-wide volunteer days in 2019 and our associates responded with a 25% year-over-year increase in volunteer hours. While the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the program in 2020, we were able to re-implement it on a limited basis in 2021. &#8203; COVID-19 and Employee Safety, Health and Wellness &#8203; The safety, health and wellness of our associates is a top priority for our associates. The COVID-19 pandemic provided unique challenges to the Company. In response, we developed a number of integrated policies and programs since the beginning of the pandemic to help ensure the safety and well-being of our associates: &#8203; &#8226; Personal Protective Equipment &#8226; Additional time off for COVID-related matters &#8226; One-time bonuses &#8226; Flexible work schedules &#8226; Work-from-home options &#8226; Vacation buy-out programs &#8226; Mental wellness programs These policies and programs have continued to evolve as the landscape has changed during the pandemic.&#8203; In addition, in connection with on-going efforts with respect to associate health and well-being in 2020, we distributed to all associates a brochure setting forth the mental health programs that our associates may access. In early 2021, we rolled out access to a confidential on-demand behavioral health support mobile application, providing associates 24\/7 access to a care team comprised of coaches and mental health professionals through text-based chats and self-guided activities at no cost to the associate. We also provide all associates with the opportunity to participate in a wide set of employee benefits, including health, dental and vision insurance coverage. &#8203; &#8203; Reporting Segments We report in two segments: Same-Store Communities and Non-Mature Communities\/Other .Our S ame-Store Communities segment represents those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to January 1, 2020, and held as of December 31, 2021. These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the communities are not classified as held for disposition at year end. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months.Our Non-Mature Communities\/Other segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in Same-Store Communities, including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. For additional information regarding our operating segments, see Note 16, Reportable Segments , in the Notes to the UDR Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.Business ObjectivesOur principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. To achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies:&#9679; own and operate a diversified portfolio of apartments in targeted markets in the United States, which are characterized by strong total income growth, high working age population growth, relatively robust rental versus single-family home affordability and measured new supply growth, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our stockholders; &#9679; manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating, redeveloping, and developing apartment communities; &#9679; empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively; &#9679; measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets; and &#9679; manage our capital structure to provide a low relative cost of capital to enhance profitability and predictability of liquidity, earnings and dividends. 2021 HighlightsCommitment to Shareholders &#9679; In July 2021, the Company marked its 49 th year as a REIT and, in November 2021, paid its 196 th consecutive quarterly dividend. The Company&#8217;s annualized declared 2021 dividend of $1.45 represented a 0.7% increase over the previous year.Property Operations &#9679; Net income attributable to common stockholders was $145.8 million as compared to $60.0 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher total net operating income (&#8220;NOI&#8221;), higher gains from dispositions of real estate, higher investment income from unconsolidated entities primarily due to unrealized gains from SmartRent, Inc. (&#8220;SmartRent&#8221;), a portfolio investment of an unconsolidated fund, becoming a public company, lower interest expense primarily due to lower debt extinguishment costs and lower interest rates partially offset by higher debt balances.&#9679; Total revenues increased 4.0% over the prior year primarily due to communities acquired during 2021 and 2020 and overall rent growth. &#9679; We achieved Same-Store revenue growth of 1.5% and Same-Store NOI growth of 0.5%.Investing and Developments &#9679; We acquired a to-be-developed parcel of land located in Tampa, Florida, for approximately $6.6 million.&#9679; We previously had a secured note with an unaffiliated third party with an aggregate commitment of $20.0 million. The note was secured by a parcel of land and related land improvements located in Alameda, California. The developer defaulted on the loan, and as a result of the default, we took title to the property pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure.&#9679; We commenced the development of one community located in Addison, Texas, with a total of 405 apartment homes.&#9679; We acquired or increased our ownership interest in twelve operating communities with a total of 5,426 apartment homes located in markets within which we already operate for a combined purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion.&#9679; We recognized gains of $136.1 million from the sale of two operating communities located in Anaheim, California.&#9679; We contributed $64.6 million to three investments under our Developer Capital Program, which earn preferred returns ranging between 9.0% and 9.7%.Balance Sheet &#9679; We assumed three fixed rate mortgage notes payable with an aggregate outstanding balance of $183.3 million and a fair value of $201.3 million in connection with the acquisition of three operating properties, which carry a weighted average interest rate of 3.93%. &#8203; &#9679; We entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, which increased our maximum aggregate borrowing capacity on our unsecured revolving credit facility to $1.3 billion from $1.1 billion, extended the maturity date to January 31, 2026, with two six-month extensions, and lowered the margin range for the interest rate. The amended agreement also extended the maturity date of our $350.0 million unsecured term loan to January 31, 2027 and lowered the margin range for the interest rate. &#9679; We amended our Working Capital Credit Facility to extend the maturity date from January 14, 2022 to January 12, 2024 and lowered the margin range for the interest rate.&#9679; We issued $300.0 million of 2.10% senior unsecured medium-term notes due June 15, 2033. The proceeds were used to redeem all of our $300.0 million 4.00% senior unsecured medium-term notes due October 2025.&#9679; We issued an additional $200.0 million of our 3.00% medium-term notes due 2031. This was a further issuance of and forms a single series with the $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2031 Notes that were issued in August 2019. The notes were priced at 106.388% of the principal amount to yield 2.259%.&#9679; We settled 19.5 million shares under forward sales agreements as part of our ATM programs and previously announced forward sales agreements for net proceeds of approximately $899.1 million.Corporate Responsibility Report We have published our 2021 Annual Corporate Responsibility Report on our website, which discloses our environmental and social programs and performance. The report&#8217;s Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosures were prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards (core), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards, and the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) framework.&#8203; Refer to Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further information on the Company&#8217;s activities in 2021.COVID-19 Update On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. The pandemic led governments and other authorities around the world, including federal, state and local authorities in the United States, to impose measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place or similar orders. While many of such measures have been lifted, they may be reinstated or other measures imposed. Further, while vaccines have been developed and are being administered, it is unclear when or if vaccines may allow a return to full pre-pandemic activity levels.While operations have been allowed to fully or partially re-open, no assurance can be given that closures or restrictions will not be reinstated or new measures imposed in the future. Our headquarters, all of our properties and our corporate offices are located in areas that have been subject to shelter-in-place orders and restrictions on the types of businesses that may continue to operate or the manner in which they may operate, for example restrictions on capacity. These orders and restrictions and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, the ability of our residents and retail and commercial tenants to pay their rent. It is still uncertain how various legislation or orders adopted by the federal government and state and local governments, or those that may be modified or enacted in the future, may continue to impact the ability of our residents and retail and commercial tenants to pay their rent. The governmental actions intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19 also caused us to reduce staffing at certain of our locations, and have impacted, and may continue to impact, our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. Further, the federal government and a number of the states, counties and municipalities in which we operate have adopted, and may extend or reinstate, eviction moratoriums, either directly or indirectly (such as through direction to law enforcement or courts not to serve notices or take actions related to eviction) or have otherwise modified their eviction processes or requirements, which have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our ability to enforce our legal and contractual rights and our ability to remove, in a timely manner, residents or retail and commercial tenants who are not paying their rent and our ability to rent their units or other space to new residents or retail and commercial tenants, respectively. In addition, certain jurisdictions have restricted our ability to charge certain fees, including fees for late payment of rent, and certain jurisdictions have adopted limits on our ability to increase rents. Earlier in the pandemic, we received more requests from our residents and retail and commercial tenants for assistance with respect to paying rent than we have historically received. In response, we instituted a number of initiatives to assist residents and other tenants, including rent deferrals, payment plans, and waiving late payment fees when appropriate. Recently, the federal government has allocated funds to rent relief programs run by state and local authorities. Certain of such programs were slow to begin operating and in certain locations funds are taking longer than expected to be distributed. Further, in certain locations, adequate funds may not exist to assist with all unpaid rent. Additionally, certain of our residents with past due rent may not qualify to receive assistance under such programs. In addition, some of such programs have required, and programs in the future may require, the forgiveness of a portion of the past due rent or other limitations or restrictions in order to participate, or may only provide funds to pay a portion of the past due rent. It remains uncertain how such programs will impact our business. Also vaccine mandates that have been adopted or may be adopted by the federal government or in states and localities in which we operate may impact our ability to operate our business in the ordinary course. &#8203; During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company performed an analysis in accordance with the ASC 842, Leases, guidance to assess the collectibility of its operating lease receivables in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis included an assessment of collectibility of current and future rents and whether those lease payments were no longer probable of collection. In accordance with the leases guidance, if lease payments are no longer deemed to be probable over the life of the lease contract, we recognize revenue only when cash is received, and all existing contractual operating lease receivables and straight-line lease receivables are reserved. &#8203; As a result of its analysis, the Company reduced its reserve to approximately $13.2 million for multifamily tenant lease receivables and increased its reserve to approximately $6.1 million for retail tenant lease receivables (inclusive of $4.0 million of reserves on straight-line lease receivables) for its wholly-owned communities and communities held by joint ventures. In aggregate, the reduction in reserve is reflected as a $0.1 million increase to Rental income and a $0.1 million increase to Income\/(loss) from unconsolidated entities on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reserved approximately $13.5 million of multifamily tenant lease receivables and approximately $6.0 million of retail tenant lease receivables (inclusive of $3.3 million of reserves on straight-line lease receivables) for its wholly-owned communities and communities held by joint ventures. In aggregate, the reserve is reflected as a $18.4 million reduction to Rental income and a $1.1 million reduction to Income\/(loss) from unconsolidated entities on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. The impact to deferred leasing commissions was not material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. &#8203; During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $3.1 million on its investment in equity securities of a non-core investment. The Company did not recognize any other adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets or asset impairment charges due to the COVID-19 pandemic for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. &#8203; As of January 31, 2022, we had collected 97.3%, 96.7% and 95.7% of billed monthly rents for our multifamily residents for October, November and December, respectively. January cash rents received are similar when compared to those for October, November and December at corresponding times of prior months. &#8203; Our Strategic Vision Our strategic vision is to be the multifamily public REIT of choice. We intend to realize this vision by executing on our strategic objectives, which are:1. Maintaining a Diversified Portfolio and Allocating Capital to Accretive Investment Opportunities 2. Maintaining a Strong Balance Sheet 3. Consistently Driving Operating Excellence 4. Advancing a Strong Corporate Culture and Ensuring High Resident Satisfaction Maintaining a Diversified Portfolio and Allocating Capital to Accretive Investment Opportunities We believe greater portfolio diversification, as defined by geographic concentration, location within a market (i.e., urban or suburban) and property quality (i.e., A or B), reduces the volatility of our same-store growth throughout the real estate cycle, appeals to a wider renter and investor audience and lessens the market risk associated with owning a homogenous portfolio. Diversified characteristics of our portfolio include:&#9679; our consolidated apartment portfolio includes 160 communities located in 21 markets throughout the U.S., including both coastal and sunbelt locations; &#9679; our communities that are located proximate to each other within a market provide enhanced economics; and &#9679; our mix of urban\/suburban communities is approximately 30%\/70% and our mix of A\/B quality properties is approximately 42%\/58%. We are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation, high propensity to rent, low single-family home affordability, and a favorable demand\/supply ratio for multifamily housing. Portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and third-party research.Acquisitions and Dispositions When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider a wide variety of factors, including:&#9679; high working age population growth, relatively robust rental versus single-family home affordability, measured new supply growth, overall potential for strong total income growth; &#9679; the tax and regulatory environment of the market in which the property is located; &#9679; geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale; &#9679; construction quality, condition and design of the property; &#9679; current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow; &#9679; ability of the property&#8217;s projected returns to exceed our cost of capital; &#9679; potential for capital appreciation of the property; &#9679; ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and redevelopment; &#9679; terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases; &#9679; occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity; &#9679; prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the property; and &#9679; competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area. We regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. Factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include:&#9679; whether it is in a market targeted for divestment or a reduction in investment; &#9679; current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset; &#9679; potential increases in new construction in the market area; &#9679; areas with low job growth prospects; &#9679; near- and long-term capital expenditure needs for the asset; and &#9679; operating efficiencies. The following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our consolidated year-end ownership position for the past five years ( dollars in thousands ):&#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Homes acquired&#160; &#8203; 5,426 &#160;&#8203; 1,642 &#160;&#8203; 7,079 &#160;&#8203; &#8212; &#160;&#8203; Homes disposed&#160; &#8203; &#160;&#8203; &#160;&#8203; &#8212; &#160;&#8203; &#160;&#8203; Homes owned at December 31, &#160; &#8203; 53,229 &#160;&#8203; 48,283 &#160;&#8203; 47,010 &#160;&#8203; 39,931 &#160;&#8203; 39,998 Total real estate owned, at cost&#8203; $ 14,740,803 &#8203; $13,071,472 &#8203; $12,602,101 &#8203; $10,196,159 &#8203; $10,177,206 &#8203; Development Activities Our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio. How demographic trends, economic drivers, and multifamily fundamentals and valuations have trended over the long-term and our portfolio strategy generally govern our review process on where and when to allocate development capital. At December 31, 2021, the Company was developing five wholly-owned communities located in Addison, Texas, Denver, Colorado, Dublin, California, Washington, D.C., and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, totaling 1,417 homes, none of which have been completed, with a budget of $501.5 million, in which we have an investment of $388.6 million. The communities are estimated to be completed between the second quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2023. Redevelopment Activities Our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred $40.3 million in major renovations, which included major structural changes and\/or architectural revisions to existing buildings. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was not redeveloping any communities.Joint Venture and Partnership Activities We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures. Our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community; (ii) our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii) our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) our projections, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and\/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement.Maintaining a Strong Balance Sheet We maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace. We have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate.As part of our plan to finance our activities, we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, fund development and redevelopment activities, and acquire apartment communities.Consistently Driving Operational Excellence Investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our business and our residents. Our residents can conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio using our web-based resident internet portal or, increasingly, a smart-device application.As a result of transforming our operations through technology, residents&#8217; satisfaction has improved, and our operating teams have become more efficient. Web-based technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and better pricing management of our available apartment homes.Competitive ConditionsCompetition for new residents is generally intense across our markets. Some competing communities offer amenities that our communities do not have. Competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. The competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors, including sub-market supply and demand. In addition, other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties, redevelop existing properties, and to develop new properties. These competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment REITs, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do.We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. We believe our competitive advantages include:&#9679; a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise; &#9679; scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our internet marketing efforts; &#9679; access to sources of capital; &#9679; geographic diversification with a presence in 21 markets across the country; and &#9679; significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert. Moving forward, we will continue to optimize lease management, improve expense control, increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with metrics that impact our bottom-line performance. We believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio&#8217;s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational upside.CommunitiesAt December 31, 2021, our consolidated real estate portfolio included 160 communities with a total of 53,229 completed apartment homes. The overall quality of our portfolio generally enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents.At December 31, 2021, the Company was developing five wholly-owned communities located in Addison, Texas, Denver, Colorado, Dublin, California, Washington, D.C., and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, totaling 1,417 homes, none of which have been completed, with a budget of $501.5 million, in which we have an investment of $388.6 million. The communities are estimated to be completed between the second quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2023.At December 31, 2021, the Company was not redeveloping any communities.Same-Store Community ComparisonWe believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our Same-Store Communities&#8217; NOI, which is total rental revenue, less rental and other operating expenses excluding property management. Our Same-Store Community population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year.Net income attributable to common stockholders was $145.8 million as compared to $60.0 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher total NOI, higher gains from dispositions of real estate, higher investment income from unconsolidated entities primarily due to unrealized gains from SmartRent, a portfolio investment of an unconsolidated fund becoming a public company, lower interest expense primarily due to lower debt extinguishment costs and lower interest rates, partially offset by higher debt balances.For the year ended December 31, 2021, our Same-Store NOI increased by $3.9 million compared to the prior year. Our Same-Store Community properties provided 91.2% of our total NOI for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in NOI for the 45,143 Same-Store apartment homes, or 84.8% of our portfolio, was primarily driven by lower rent concessions, lower vacancy, lower bad debt expense, a decrease in personnel expense and an increase in reimbursement, ancillary and fee income, partially offset by a decrease in rental rates and higher repair and maintenance expense, insurance expense, and real estate tax expense.Revenue growth in 2022 may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the general economy, inclusive of economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, new supply, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents.Tax MattersUDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To continue to qualify as a REIT, UDR must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. Provided we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.We may utilize our taxable REIT subsidiary (&#8220;TRS&#8221;) to engage in activities that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. Our TRS generally is taxable as a regular corporation, and therefore, subject to federal, state and local income taxes.Inflation Inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and repair and maintenance costs. In addition, inflation could also impact our general and administrative expenses, the interest on our debt if variable or refinanced in a high-inflationary environment, and our cost of development activities. However, the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. Although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this had a material impact on our results for the year ended December 31, 2021.Environmental MattersVarious environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. Such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and\/or claims for damages by a private party.To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have a property management plan for hazardous materials. As part of the plan, Phase I environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. In addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. The inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. We do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. We believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards.Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities.We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. We do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. Future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.InsuranceWe carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. We are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.Available InformationWe file electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

BUSINESS &#160; The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. &#160; As used in this annual report on Form 10-K and unless otherwise indicated, the terms the terms &#8220;Zoned Properties&#8221;, &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Zoned Properties, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Gilbert Property Management, LLC, Green Valley Group, LLC, Kingman Property Group, LLC, Chino Valley Properties, LLC, Zoned Oregon Properties, LLC, Zoned Colorado Properties, LLC, Zoned Illinois Properties, LLC, Zoned Arizona Properties, LLC, Zoned Advisory Services, LLC, Zoned Properties Brokerage, LLC, and ZP Data Platform 1, LLC as the context may require. &#160; Overview &#160; &#160; Zoned Properties, Inc. (&#8220;Zoned Properties&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 25, 2003. The Company is a real estate development firm for emerging and highly regulated industries, including regulated cannabis. The Company is redefining the approach to commercial real estate investment through its integrated growth services. Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, Zoned Properties has developed a full spectrum of integrated growth services to support its real estate development and investment model; Advisory Services, Brokerage Services, Franchise Services, and Property Technology (&#8220;PropTech&#8221;) Data Services each cross-pollinate within the model to drive project value associated with complex real estate projects. With national experience and a team of experts devoted to the emerging cannabis industry, Zoned Properties is addressing the specific needs of a modern market in highly regulated industries. Zoned Properties is an accredited member of the Better Business Bureau, the U.S. Green Building Council, and the Forbes Real Estate Council. The Company does not grow, harvest, sell or distribute cannabis or any substances regulated under United States law such as the Controlled Substance Act of 1970, as amended (the &#8220;CSA&#8221;). &#160; The Company has the following wholly owned subsidiaries: &#160; &#160; &#9679; Gilbert Property Management, LLC (&#8220;Gilbert&#8221;) was organized in the State of Arizona on February 10, 2014. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Chino Valley Properties, LLC (&#8220;Chino Valley&#8221;) was organized in the State of Arizona on April 15, 2014. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Kingman Property Group, LLC (&#8220;Kingman&#8221;) was organized in the State of Arizona on April 15, 2014. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Green Valley Group, LLC (&#8220;Green Valley&#8221;) organized in the State of Arizona on April 15, 2014. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Zoned Oregon Properties, LLC was organized in the State of Oregon on June 16, 2015 and is currently inactive. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Zoned Colorado Properties, LLC (&#8220;Zoned Colorado&#8221;) was organized in the State of Colorado on September 17, 2015 and is currently inactive. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Zoned Illinois Properties, LLC (&#8220;Zoned Illinois&#8221;) was organized in the State of Illinois on July 15, 2015 and is currently inactive. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Zoned Arizona Properties, LLC (&#8220;Zoned Arizona&#8221;) was organized in the State of Arizona on June 2, 2017. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Zoned Advisory Services, LLC (&#8220;Zoned Advisory&#8221;) was organized in the State of Arizona on July 27, 2018. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Zoned Properties Brokerage, LLC (&#8220;Zoned Brokerage&#8221;) was organized in the State of Arizona on March 17, 2021. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; ZP Data Platform 1, LLC (&#8220;ZP Data&#8221;) was organized in the State of Arizona on April 14, 2021. &#160; In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The Company is monitoring this closely, and although operations have not been materially affected by the COVID-19 outbreak to date, the ultimate duration and severity of the outbreak and its impact on the economic environment and our business is uncertain. Currently, all of the properties in the Company&#8217;s portfolio are open to its Significant Tenants and their customers and will remain open pursuant to state and local government requirements. The Company did not experience in 2020 or 2021 and does not foresee in 2022, any material changes to its operations from COVID-19. The Company&#8217;s tenants are continuing to generate revenue at these properties, and they have continued to make rental payments in full and on time and we believe the tenants&#8217; liquidity position is sufficient to cover its expected rental obligations. Accordingly, while the Company does not anticipate an impact on its operations, it cannot estimate the duration of the pandemic and potential impact on its business if the properties must close or if the tenants are otherwise unable or unwilling to make rental payments. In addition, a severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to the Company&#8217;s business, including weakened demand for its properties and a decreased ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. &#160; &#160;&#160;Our Business &#160; We are a real estate development firm for emerging and highly regulated industries, including regulated cannabis. We are redefining the approach to commercial real estate investment through our integrated growth services. Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, we have developed a full spectrum of integrated growth services to support our real estate development and investment model; Advisory Services, Brokerage Services, Franchise Services, and PropTech Data Services each cross-pollinate within the model to drive project value associated with complex real estate projects. With national experience and a team of experts devoted to the emerging cannabis industry, we are addressing the specific needs of a modern market in highly regulated industries. We are an accredited member of the Better Business Bureau, the U.S. Green Building Council, and the Forbes Real Estate Council. We do not grow, harvest, sell or distribute cannabis or any substances regulated under United States law such as the Controlled Substance Act of 1970, as amended (the &#8220;CSA&#8221;). &#160; We are in the process of developing and expanding multiple business divisions; including an advisory services division, a licensed commercial real estate brokerage division, a real estate division focused on franchise services, a real estate division focused on property technology data for real estate, and a nonprofit charitable organization to focus on community prosperity. Each of these operating divisions are important elements of the overall business development strategy for long-term growth. We believe in the value of building relationships with clients and local communities in order to position the Company for long-term portfolio and revenue growth backed by sophisticated, safe, and sustainable assets and clients. &#160; The core of our business involves identifying and developing commercial properties that intend to operate within highly regulated industries, including the regulated cannabis industry. Within highly regulated industries, local municipalities typically develop strict regulations, including zoning and permitting requirements related to commercial real estate, that dictate the specific locations and parameters under which regulated properties can operate. These regulations often include complex permitting processes and can include non-standard codes governing each location; for example, restricting a regulated property or facility from operating within a certain distance of any parks, schools, churches, or residential districts, or restricting a regulated property from operating outside a defined set of hours of operation. When an organization can collaborate with local representatives, a proactive set of rules and regulations can be established and followed to meet the needs of both the regulated operators and the local community. &#160; The Company currently maintains a portfolio of properties that we own, develop, and lease. We currently lease land and\/or building space at all four of the properties in our portfolio. These properties are leased to licensed and regulated cannabis tenants and are located in areas with established zoning and permitting procedures. Two of the leased properties are zoned and permitted as licensed and regulated cannabis dispensaries, and two of the leased properties are zoned and permitted as licensed and regulated cannabis cultivation facilities. Each regulated property may undergo a non-standard development process. Various development requirements in this process may include initial property identification, zoning authorization, and permitting guidance in order to qualify a commercial property for subsequent architectural design, utility installation, construction and development, property management, facilities management systems, and security system installation. &#160; On June 1, 2021, we closed on the sale of our Gilbert, AZ property with a third party (the &#8220;Purchaser&#8221;) pursuant to which we agreed to sell, and the Purchaser agreed to purchase, the property located in Gilbert, Arizona, for an aggregate purchase price of $335,000. In connection with the sale, we received net proceeds of $322,332 and recorded a gain on sale of rental property of $51,944. &#160; There are significant challenges that take place when zoning, permitting, and developing real estate with facilities that intend to operate within a regulated industry, including the regulated cannabis industry. Each state and local jurisdiction may adopt specific zoning and permitting regulations that may be unique compared to alternative jurisdictions. The Company has gained valuable knowledge and developed best practices in this area by successfully completing project for third party clients across the country in multiple state and our own major projects in the state of Arizona, a highly regulated market for the regulated cannabis industry. The Company intends to replicate this business model across the nation as markets mature and rules and regulations are established. &#160; The process for obtaining zoning authorizations and permitting for a regulated cannabis facility can take months or sometimes years to complete. The process primarily involves working directly with the local government representatives following state-level legalization. Notwithstanding proper zoning and permitted use, we may work with local zoning authorities in order to revise zoning codes and regulations. The Company has been involved with local representatives for each of the properties currently held in our portfolio and on behalf of third-part client properties across the nation. For example, the Company worked directly with local representatives in Tempe, Arizona to update the local zoning code that regulates licensed cannabis facilities. The successfully adoption of these code amendments directly impact the continued development of any licensed cannabis facilities that operate within municipal limits. &#160; In the event a property is not currently zoned correctly or does not currently allow permitted use as a regulated cannabis facility, we may work with local authorities to rezone the property or seek changes to existing zoning codes or permitted uses. Our efforts may not be successful. For example, the property we sold in June of 2021 located in Gilbert, Arizona was not successfully zoned and permitted for a prospective regulated cannabis facility and was ultimately divested as a non-core asset. &#160; The Company has established a network of experts in the fields of real estate, design, engineering, construction, operations, security, and corporate social responsibility in order to provide tenants and clients with a full-spectrum of real estate solutions to best meet their needs. We require our prospective tenants and clients to go through due diligence in order to meet the Company&#8217;s standards. &#160; Our vision is to be recognized for setting the standard in sustainable development for emerging industries, while increasing community prosperity and shareholder value. We believe that a focus on real estate and the sustainable development of properties will bring value to the local communities in which we operate and to local stakeholders. While we intend to expand into a variety of emerging industries, our current focus is on real estate projects within the regulated cannabis industry. &#160; &#160;&#160; We are the sole member of eleven limited liability companies: Zoned Advisory, Zoned Arizona, Gilbert, Green Valley, Kingman, Chino Valley, Zoned Colorado, Zoned Illinois, Zoned Oregon, Zoned Brokerage, and ZP Data. Four of these entities own our properties: Zoned Arizona, Green Valley, Kingman, and Chino Valley have all acquired land and\/or real property. &#160; Multiple state-licensed operators from across the United States have approached Zoned Properties for strategic partnership and\/or advisory services for development and prospective sale-lease back arrangements. We are continuously evaluating these projects as we seek development partnerships, prospective sale-lease back arrangements, and explore financing terms with capital funding sources. &#160; We are a non-plant touching organization. We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from ancillary development opportunities that the regulated cannabis industry presents without having to deal with the risk of directly cultivating, distributing, or dispensing the product, which is still illegal under federal law. &#160; Our initial holdings and acquisition targets have been in the State of Arizona. Unlike many other states that have legalized and regulated cannabis, Arizona&#8217;s program has some of the most robust regulations in the country and limits the number of dispensaries that will be allowed to be open and operate within the state. While there are hundreds of dispensaries in Denver, Colorado, the entire state of Arizona will have a maximum of 169 operating dispensaries under current legislation. This limitation on the number of dispensaries permitted to operate in Arizona under current legislation may limit our ability to purchase additional property in Arizona for lease to dispensary operators. &#160; Recent Corporate History and Transactions &#160; On May 1, 2018, Zoned Arizona, Green Valley Group, Kingman Property, and Chino Valley Properties executed lease agreements with our Significant Tenant at each of the respective properties. These locations generate rental revenue. The lease agreements have a 22-year term, expiring on April 30, 2040. &#160; The leases dated May 1, 2018, with Zoned Arizona, Green Valley, Kingman, and Chino Valley each include a Guarantee of Payment and Performance by Mr. Abrams and the tenant organizations. &#160; Chino Valley &#160; On May 29, 2020, Chino Valley and Broken Arrow entered into a second amendment to the 2018 Chino Valley Lease, as amended (the &#8220;2020 Chino Valley Amendment&#8221;), effective May 31, 2020 (&#8220;Effective Date&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the 2020 Chino Valley Amendment, among other things, the base rent was adjusted to $32,800 per month, and the base rent was abated from June 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020. Any increase in the rentable area of the leased premises will result in an increase in all amounts calculated based on the same, including, without limitation, base rent. Pursuant to the terms of the 2020 Chino Valley Amendment, the parties agreed that if there is any change in laws such that the dispensing, sale or cultivation of marijuana upon the premises is prohibited or materially and adversely affected as mutually and reasonably determined by Chino Valley and Broken Arrow, Broken Arrow may terminate the 2018 Chino Valley Lease, as amended, by delivering written notice to Chino Valley, together with a termination payment which shall be the sum of (i) any unpaid rent and interest, plus (ii) 5% of the base rent which would have been earned after termination for the balance of the term. &#160; In addition, the parties agreed that from the period from the Effective Date to June 30, 2022 (the &#8220;Improvement Period&#8221;), Broken Arrow will and\/or Broken Arrow will cause its affiliate, CJK, Inc. (&#8220;CJK&#8221;), to invest a combined total of at least $8,000,000 of improvements (&#8220;Investment by Tenants&#8221;) in and to the property that is the subject of the Chino Valley Lease and the property that is the subject of the Tempe Lease (discussed below, and collectively referred to as the &#8220;Facilities&#8221;). As of December 31, 2021, the Company&#8217;s Significant Tenants have completed improvements to the Facilities totaling in excess of $8,000,000 and have satisfied the contractual obligations related to the same. &#160; On August 23, 2021, Chino Valley and Broken Arrow entered into the Third Amendment (the &#8220;Third Chino Valley Amendment&#8221;) to the Licensed Medical Marijuana Facility Triple Net (NNN) Lease Agreement dated May 1, 2018, between Chino Valley and CJK, as amended (the &#8220;Chino Valley Lease&#8221;), effective September 1, 2021. &#160; &#160;&#160;Pursuant to the terms of the Chino Valley Lease, the parties previously agreed that between May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2022 (the &#8220;Improvement Period&#8221;), Broken Arrow would and\/or Broken Arrow would cause its affiliate, CJK, to invest a combined total of at least $8,000,000 of improvements in and to the property that is the subject of the Chino Valley Lease. The parties also previously agreed that the base rental payments under the Chino Valley Lease would increase commensurate to any and all expanded and operational square footage on the premises by calculating the fixed rate of $0.82 per square foot per month by the new operational square footage. Broken Arrow has now satisfied its contractual obligation regarding these capital improvements. &#160; Accordingly, in the Third Chino Valley Amendment, the parties agreed that, as of September 1, 2021, the rental payment is increased to $55,195 per month base rental payment, plus additional rental payments, as a result of the increase in the square footage of the operational space. This lease modification qualifies as a separate contract as the modification grants the tenant additional right of use not included in the original lease, as amended, and the increase in monthly rent payments is commensurate with the standalone price for the additional square footage being leased. &#160; Effective January 24, 2022, Chino Valley and Broken Arrow entered into the Fourth Amendment (the &#8220;Fourth Chino Valley Amendment&#8221;) to the Licensed Medical Marijuana Facility Triple Net (NNN) Lease Agreement dated May 1, 2018, between Chino Valley and CJK, as amended. Pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Chino Valley Amendment, the parties acknowledge that an additional 30,000 square feet have become operational, increasing the premises to a total of 97,312 square feet of operational space. In connection with the Fourth Chino Valley Amendment, the Company paid $500,000 to CJK as a tenant improvement allowance for investment into the premises, which shall be capitalized as a lease incentive receivable and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term as a reduction to the lease income. &#160; Pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Chino Valley Amendment, effective March 1, 2022, the monthly base rent was increased to $87,581, representing an increase from $0.82 per square foot to $0.90 per square foot, for all current and future operational square footage that may be developed as the premises continues to expand. In addition, Broken Arrow agreed that it would provide audited financial statements to Chino Valley on an annual basis no later than March 20 th of each calendar year. &#160; Green Valley &#160; On May 29, 2020, Green Valley and Broken Arrow entered into the First Amendment (the &#8220;Green Valley Amendment&#8221;) to the Green Valley Lease, effective May 31, 2020. Pursuant to the terms of the Green Valley Amendment, among other things, the parties agreed to abate the fixed base rent of $3,500 from June 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020. In addition, the Green Valley Amendment provides that any increase in the rentable area of the leases premises will result in an increase in all amounts calculated based on the same, including, without limitation, base rent. The parties also agreed that if there is any change in laws such that the dispensing, sale or cultivation of cannabis upon the premises is prohibited or materially and adversely affected as mutually and reasonably determined by Green Valley and Broken Arrow, Broken Arrow may terminate the Green Valley Lease by delivering written notice to Green Valley, together with a termination payment which shall be the sum of (i) any unpaid rent and interest, plus (ii) 5% of the base rent which would have been earned after termination for the balance of the term. &#160; Tempe &#160; On May 29, 2020, Zoned Arizona and CJK entered into the First Amendment (the &#8220;Tempe Amendment&#8221;) to the Tempe Lease, effective May 31, 2020. Pursuant to the terms of the Tempe Amendment, among other things, the base rent was increased to $49,200 per month, and the base rent was abated from June 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020. Any increase in the rentable area of the leased premises will result in an increase in all amounts calculated based on the same, including, without limitation, base rent. Pursuant to the terms of the Tempe Amendment, the parties agreed that if there is any change in laws such that the dispensing, sale or cultivation of marijuana upon the premises is prohibited or materially and adversely affected as mutually and reasonably determined by Zoned Arizona and CJK, CJK may terminate the Tempe Lease by delivering written notice to Zoned Arizona, together with a termination payment which shall be the sum of (i) any unpaid rent and interest, plus (ii) 5% of the base rent which would have been earned after termination for the balance of the term. In addition, under the Tempe Amendment the parties agreed to an Investment by Tenant (as defined above in the subheading Chino Valley ) to the property that is the subject of the Chino Valley Lease and the property that is the subject of the Tempe Lease. If Broken Arrow and\/or CJK fails to deliver to the Company receipted bills for hard and soft costs of improvements to the Facilities totaling at least $8,000,000 on or before June 30, 2022, Broken Arrow and CJK will be in default under the Chino Valley Lease and Tempe Lease, as amended. As of December 31, 2021, the Company&#8217;s Significant Tenants have completed improvements to the Facilities totaling in excess of $8,000,000 and have satisfied the contractual obligations related to the same. As soon as the improved, rentable areas have received all required approvals for occupancy and commencement of operations, the Company and Broken Arrow expect to complete any appropriate amendments to the Lease Agreement. &#160;Kingman &#160; On May 29, 2020, Kingman and CJK entered into the First Amendment (the &#8220;Kingman Amendment&#8221;) to the Kingman Lease, effective May 31, 2020. Pursuant to the terms of the Kingman Amendment, among other things, the parties agreed to abate the $4,000 base rent from June 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020. In addition, the Kingman Amendment provides that any increase in the rentable area of the leases premises will result in an increase in all amounts calculated based on the same, including, without limitation, base rent. The parties also agreed that if there is any change in laws such that the dispensing, sale or cultivation of cannabis upon the premises is prohibited or materially and adversely affected as mutually and reasonably determined by Kingman and CJK, CJK may terminate the Kingman Lease by delivering written notice to Kingman, together with a termination payment which shall be the sum of (i) any unpaid rent and interest, plus (ii) 5% of the base rent which would have been earned after termination for the balance of the term. &#160;&#160;&#160; CJK and Broken Arrow, together, operate under the company brand, &#8220;Hana Meds&#8221;, and are referred to as the Company&#8217;s Significant Tenants. &#160; During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, substantially all of the Company&#8217;s real estate properties are leased under triple-net leases to tenants that are controlled by one entity (each, a &#8220;Significant Tenant&#8221; and collectively, the &#8220;Significant Tenants&#8221;). For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, rental and advisory revenue associated with the Significant Tenants amounted to $1,255,130 and $1,176,666, which represents 68.9% and 96.8% of the Company&#8217;s total revenues, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had an asset concentration related to the Significant Tenants. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Significant Tenants represented approximately 79.2% and 83.2% of the Company&#8217;s total assets, respectively.&#160;Future minimum lease payments primarily consist of minimum base rent payments from Significant Tenants. Future minimum lease payments to be received, on all leased properties, for each of the five succeeding calendar years and thereafter as of December 31, 2021 consists of the following: &#160;Future annual base rent *: &#160; &#160; &#160; 2022 &#160; $ 1,362,403 &#160; 2023 &#160; &#160; 1,362,403 &#160; 2024 &#160; &#160; 1,362,403 &#160; 2025 &#160; &#160; 1,362,403 &#160; 2026 &#160; &#160; 1,350,939 &#160; Thereafter &#160; &#160; 17,903,334 &#160; Total &#160; $ 24,703,885 &#160; &#160; * Future annual base rent does not include the Fourth Chino Valley Amendment, effective March 1, 2022 which increased the monthly base rent to $87,581, or an annual base rent to $1,050,972 (See Chino Valley above).&#160; KCB Jade Holdings, LLC Investment &#160; On March 19, 2020, the Company made an initial investment of $100,000 into KCB Jade Holdings, LLC (&#8220;KCB&#8221;). In exchange for the investment, KCB issued to the Company a convertible debenture (the &#8220;KCB Debenture&#8221;) dated March 19, 2020 (the &#8220;Issuance Date&#8221;) in the original principal amount of $100,000. The KCB Debenture bears interest at the rate of 6.5% per annum and matures on March 19, 2025 (the &#8220;Maturity Date&#8221;). Interest on the outstanding principal sum of the KCB Debenture commences accruing on the Issuance Date and is computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed and shall be payable annually due by the first day of each calendar anniversary following the Issuance Date. KCB may prepay the KCB Debenture at any point after 18 months following the Issuance Date, in whole or in part. However, if KCB elects to prepay the KCB Debenture prior to the Maturity Date or prior to any conversion as provided in the KCB Debenture in whole or in part, the Company will be entitled to receive a number of KCB units, in addition to such prepayment amount, constituting 10% of the total outstanding units and 10% of the total percentage interest following such issuance and at the time of such issuance. &#160; On or after six months from the Issuance Date, the Company may convert all or a portion of the principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest due into a number of units equal to the proportion of the outstanding amount being converted multiplied by 33% of the total number of units issued and outstanding at the time of conversion, constituting 33% of the total percentage interest (the &#8220;Conversion Percentage&#8221;). If KCB defaults on payment of the KCB Debenture, the Company may, at its option, extend all conversion rights, through and including the date KCB tenders or attempts to tender payment in full of all amounts due under the KCB Debenture. Conversion rights terminate upon acceptance by the Company of payment in full of principal, accrued interest and any other amounts due under the KCB Debenture. &#160; If (i) KCB does not elect to exercise its rights of prepayment prior to the Maturity Date, (ii) the Company does not elect to exercise its rights of conversion, and (iii) KCB pays to the Company all outstanding principal and interest accrued and due under the terms of the KCB Debenture on the Maturity Date, the Company will still be entitled to receive a number of units, in addition to such payment amount, constituting 8% of the total outstanding units and 8% of the total percentage interest following such issuance and at the time of such issuance. &#160; Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, as defined in the KCB Debenture, the entire principal balance and accrued and unpaid interest outstanding under the KCB Debenture, and all other obligations of KCB under the KCB Debenture, will be immediately due and payable and the Company may exercise any and all rights, power and remedies available to it at law or in equity or other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in the KCB Debenture and proceed to enforce the payment thereof or any other legal or equitable right of the Company. &#160; Any amount of principal or interest not paid when due will bear interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the due date thereof until paid. &#160; &#160;&#160;On February 19, 2021 (the &#8220;Amendment Date&#8221;), the Company made an additional investment of $100,000 into KCB (the &#8220;Additional Investment&#8221;). In exchange, KCB issued to the Company an amended and restated convertible debenture (the &#8220;A&#38;R Debenture&#8221;) on the Amendment Date. The A&#38;R Debenture amends and restates in its entirety the KCB Debenture. Pursuant to the A&#38;R Debenture, the Company and KCB agreed to certain new terms that did not exist in the KCB Debenture, which are described below. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Interest Accrual Commencement : Pursuant to the A&#38;R Debenture, interest on the Initial Investment begins accruing as of March 19, 2020, while interest on the Additional Investment begins accruing on February 19, 2021. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Franchise Fees . In the A&#38;R Debenture, the parties acknowledge that each time that KCB sells one of its franchise locations, KCB earns a fee (an &#8220;Initial Fee&#8221;), and that KCB also earns a fee when one of its franchise locations renews its franchise with KCB (a &#8220;Renewal Fee&#8221;). Pursuant to the A&#38;R Debenture, the Company and KCB agreed that, as additional consideration for the Additional Investment, KCB will pay to the Company, in perpetuity, 5% of any Initial Fee received by KCB after the Amendment Date, as well as 5% of any Renewal Fee received by KCB related to any franchise locations sold after the Amendment Date, in each case to be paid within five (5) days of receipt of KCB thereof. &#160; In addition, following the Amendment Date, KCB agreed not to decrease the amount it charges its franchise locations for an Initial Fee or any Renewal Fee as in effect on the Amendment Date without the prior written consent of the Company, or to take any other actions that would reduce the value of KCB&#8217;s obligation to the Company with respect to these franchise fee payments. KCB&#8217;s obligation to pay the Company the franchise fees listed above will survive any termination, repayment or conversion of the A&#38;R Debenture. Failure by KCB to pay the Company the franchise fees in the manner described above will result in an event of default, and, among other things, any due and unpaid franchise fees will accrue interest at 12% per year from the date the obligation was due. &#160; Apart from the terms described above, the terms of the A&#38;R Debenture are substantially identical to the terms of the KCB Debenture. &#160; On August 2, 2021, KCB issued to the Company a second amended and restated convertible debenture (the &#8220;Second A&#38;R Debenture&#8221;). The Second A&#38;R Debenture amends and restates in its entirety the A&#38;R Debenture. Pursuant to the Second A&#38;R Debenture, the Company and KCB agreed to revise certain terms in the A&#38;R Debenture, as follows. &#160; Right of Prepayment . KCB may prepay the Second A&#38;R Debenture at any point after 18 months following the Issue Date, in whole or in part. However, if KCB elects to prepay the Second A&#38;R Debenture prior to March 19, 2025 (the &#8220;Maturity Date&#8221;) or prior to any conversion in whole or in part, the Company will be entitled to receive a number of KCB Class B units (&#8220;Class B Units&#8221;), in addition to such prepayment amount, constituting 10% of the total outstanding KCB Units (as defined in KCB&#8217;s Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement (the &#8220;Operating Agreement&#8221;)), for the avoidance of doubt, being 10% of the total of KCB&#8217;s Class A units (&#8220;Class A Units&#8221;) and the Class B Units together, and 10% of the total Percentage Interest (as defined in the Operating Agreement) following such issuance and at the time of such issuance. &#160; Voluntary Conversion . On or after six months from the Issue Date, the Company is entitled to convert all or a portion of the principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest due under the Second A&#38;R Debenture (the &#8220;Outstanding Amount&#8221;) into a number of Class B Units equal to the proportion of the Outstanding Amount being converted multiplied by the Conversion Percentage, as defined below). Should KCB default on payment hereof, the Company may, at its option, extend all conversion rights, through and including the date KCB tenders or attempts to tender payment in full of all amounts due under the Second A&#38;R Debenture. Conversion rights will terminate upon acceptance by the Company of payment in full of principal, accrued interest and any other amounts due under the Second A&#38;R Debenture. &#160; Conversion Percentage. The Conversion Percentage will be 33% of the total number of Units (for the avoidance of doubt, being 33% of the total of the Class A Units and the Class B Units together), issued and outstanding at the time of conversion, constituting 33% of the total Percentage Interest (the &#8220;Conversion Percentage&#8221;). &#160; Right of Maturity Units . If (i) KCB does not elect to exercise its prepayment rights prior to the Maturity Date, and (ii) the Company does not elect to exercise its conversion rights, and (iii) KCB pays to the Company all outstanding principal and interest accrued and due under the terms of the Second A&#38;R Debenture on the Maturity Date, then the Company will still be entitled to receive a number of Class B Units, in addition to such payment amount, constituting 8% of the total outstanding Units (for the avoidance of doubt, being 8% of the total of the Class A Units and the Class B Units together) and 8% of the total Percentage Interest (as such term is defined in the Second A&#38;R Debenture) following such issuance and at the time of such issuance. &#160; Apart from the terms described above, the terms of the Second A&#38;R Debenture are substantially identical to the terms of the A&#38;R Debenture. &#160; Gilbert Property &#160; On March 3, 2021, Gilbert entered into that certain Commercial Lease Agreement (the &#8220;Lease&#8221;), dated as of February 26, 2021, between Gilbert and AZ2CAL Enterprises, LLC (the &#8220;Tenant&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the Lease, Gilbert agreed to rent the property located at 988 S. 182 nd Place, Gilbert, AZ (the &#8220;Property&#8221;) to the Tenant for a term of 24 months, from April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2023, for monthly rent of $2,750; provided, however, that no rent is due for the month of April 2021. &#160; &#160;&#160; In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Lease, the Tenant has an option to purchase the Property (the &#8220;Option&#8221;) that can be exercised any time after the fourth month of the lease term, but no later than the end of the 12 th month of the lease term. On June 1, 2021, the Company closed on the sale of its Gilbert, AZ property with the Tenant pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell, and the Tenant agreed to purchase the property located in Gilbert, Arizona, for an aggregate purchase price of $335,000. In connection with the sale, the Company received net proceeds of $322,332 and recorded a gain on sale of rental property of $51,944. &#160; Investment in Joint Ventures &#160; On December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company held investments with aggregate carrying values of $74,554 and $0, respectively. The entities listed below are partially owned by the Company. The Company accounts for these investments under the equity method of accounting as the Company exercises significant influence but does not exercise financial and operating control over these entities. Investments are reviewed for changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events that suggest an other than temporary event where the Company&#8217;s investment may not be recoverable. &#160; On April 22, 2021, ZP Data entered into a Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement (the &#8220;Beakon Operating Agreement&#8221;) with a non-affiliated joint venture partner in connection with the formation of Beakon, LLC (&#8220;Beakon&#8221;), a Delaware limited liability company formed on April 16, 2021. Beakon signed a licensing agreement for the licensing of a consumer data\/marketing software platform that Beakon will white-label for the cannabis industry. Beakon&#8217;s goal is to develop and leverage the platform to help drive foot traffic to brick and mortar retail (i.e. dispensaries), and thus enhance the value of the real estate and mitigate risk. Pursuant to the Beakon Operating Agreement, ZP Data purchased 50 units of Beakon for $50, which represent 50% of the membership interests of Beakon. Each unit represents, with respect to any member, such member&#8217;s: (i) interest in Beakon&#8217;s capital, (ii) share of Beakon&#8217;s net profits and net losses (and specially allocated items of income, gain, and deduction), and the right to receive distributions of net cash flow from Beakon, (iii) right to inspect Beakon&#8217;s books and records, and (iv) right to participate in the management of and vote on matters coming before the members as provided in the Beakon Operating Agreement. The transactions discussed above resulted in a joint venture, in accordance with ASC 323-10 &#8211; Investments- Equity and Joint Ventures, between ZP Data and the non-affiliated party. Each of the entities has 50% equity ownership and voting rights, and joint control in Beakon. ZP Data will account for its investment in Beakon under the equity method of accounting in accordance with ASC 323. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company contributed $86,000 to Beakon. On December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $73,970 because it was determined that the fair value of its equity method investment in Beakon was less than its carrying value. Based on management&#8217;s evaluation, it was determined that due to market conditions and lack of committed funding, the Company&#8217;s ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment in Beakon was impaired. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the $73,970 impairment loss is included within loss from unconsolidated joint ventures on the consolidated statement of operations. &#160; On May 1, 2021, the Company entered into a Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement (the &#8220;Zoneomics Green Operating Agreement&#8221;) with a non-affiliated joint venture partner in connection with the formation of Zoneomics Green, LLC (&#8220;Zoneomics Green&#8221;), a Delaware limited liability company formed on May 1, 2021. Zoneomics Green&#8217;s goal is to utilize advanced property technology to provide solutions for property identification in regulated industries such as regulated cannabis. Pursuant to the Zoneomics Green Operating Agreement, the Company purchased 50 units of Zoneomics Green for a capital contribution of $90,000, which represent 50% of the membership interests of Zoneomics Green. Each unit represents, with respect to any member, such member&#8217;s: (i) interest in Zoneomics Green&#8217;s capital, (ii) share of Zoneomics Green&#8217;s net profits and net losses (and specially allocated items of income, gain, and deduction), and the right to receive distributions of net cash flow from Zoneomics Green, (iii) right to inspect Zoneomics Green&#8217;s books and records, and (iv) right to participate in the management of and vote on matters coming before the members as provided in the Zoneomics Green Operating Agreement. The transactions discussed above resulted in a joint venture, in accordance with ASC 323-10 &#8211; Investments- Equity and Joint Ventures, between the Company and the non-affiliated party. Each of the entities has 50% equity ownership and voting rights, and joint control in Zoneomics Green. In June 2021, the Company contributed $90,000 to Zoneomics Green. &#160; Clients &#160; We target clients who require assistance with the identification and development of regulated cannabis properties. Our ideal prospective clients will have a commitment to sophisticated, safe, and sustainable project development. The most significant barrier to success for many industry operators and prospective clients includes distractions from primary business operations. These distractions often include services related to the identification, zoning, permitting, and development of real estate. &#160; We complete significant due diligence on prospective tenants and prospective clients regardless of industry focus. Credit-worthiness, character, and cash flows are all important traits that contribute to a sophisticated client for the Company. &#160; Marketing &#160; Currently, the Company does not actively market its services using any direct marketing campaigns. Industry reputation, word-of-mouth, and networking are the primary tools used to complete the marketing of our services. We have engaged a public relations firm, Proven Media, to assist with our industry branding and to help maintain an updated website, shareholder presentation, and profile outlining the Company&#8217;s services. These tools are created for transparency of operations and activities. Our executive management believes the reputation of having integrity is an essential tool for marketing and business development. &#160; &#160;&#160; Competition &#160; The commercial real estate market is highly competitive. We believe finding properties that are zoned for the specific use of allowing regulated cannabis operations may be limited as more competitors enter the market. Several competitors have recently entered the marketplace. We face significant competition from a diverse mix of market participants, including but not limited to, other public companies with similar business models, independent investors, hedge funds and other real estate investors, hard money lenders, as well as would be clients, regulated cannabis operators themselves, all of whom, who may compete against us in our efforts to acquire real estate zoned for cannabis grow and retail operations. In some instances, we will be competing to acquire real estate with persons who have no interest in the regulated cannabis business but have identified value in a piece of real estate that we may be interested in acquiring. &#160; Government Regulation &#160; &#160; Real Estate &#38; General Business Regulations &#160; We are subject to applicable provisions of federal and state securities laws and to regulations specifically governing the real estate industry, including those governing fair housing and federally backed mortgage programs. Our operations will also be subject to regulations normally incident to business operations, such as occupational safety and health acts, workmen&#8217;s compensation statutes, unemployment insurance legislation and income tax and social security related regulations. Although we will use our best efforts to comply with applicable regulations, we can provide no assurance of our ability to do so, nor can we fully predict the effect of these regulations on our proposed activities. &#160; In addition, zoning commercial properties for specific purposes, such as regulated cannabis dispensaries or cultivation facilities, is subject to specific regulations to the zoning requirements for the city, county and state related to any regulated cannabis facility. We expect regulations to get tighter as time goes on. &#160; Federal and State Regulation of Cannabis &#160; The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that it is the federal government that has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes. Therefore, federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana preempts state laws that legalize its use for medicinal purposes. &#160; The U.S. federal government regulates drugs through the CSA, which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the &#8220;DOJ&#8221;) defines Schedule I drugs, substances or chemicals as &#8220;drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.&#8221; However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) has approved Epidiolex, which contains a purified form of the drug cannabidiol (&#8220;CBD&#8221;), a non-psychoactive ingredient in the cannabis plant, for the treatment of seizures associated with two epilepsy conditions. The FDA has not approved cannabis or cannabis compounds as a safe and effective drug for any other condition. Moreover, pursuant to the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the &#8220;Farm Bill&#8221;), CBD remains a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA, with a narrow exception for CBD derived from hemp with a tetrahydrocannabinol (&#8220;THC&#8221;) concentration of less than 0.3%. &#160; The Company maintains its operations so as to remain in compliance with the CSA. Even in those jurisdictions in which the manufacture and use of medical marijuana has been legalized at the state level, the possession, use and cultivation all remain violations of federal law that are punishable by imprisonment and substantial fines, and the prescription of marijuana is a violation of federal law. Moreover, individuals and entities may violate federal law if they intentionally aid and abet another in violating these federal controlled substance laws or conspire with another to violate them. &#160; The inconsistencies between federal and state regulation of cannabis were addressed in a memorandum (the &#8220;Cole Memo&#8221;) which then-Deputy Attorney General James Cole sent to all U.S. District Attorneys in 2013 outlining certain priorities for the DOJ relating to the prosecution of cannabis offenses. The Cole Memo acknowledged that, notwithstanding the designation of cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level, several states had enacted laws authorizing the use of cannabis for medical purposes. The Cole Memo noted that jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis. As such, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to implicate the Cole Memo&#8217;s enforcement priorities. The DOJ did not provide (and has not provided since) specific guidelines for what regulatory and enforcement systems would be deemed sufficient under the Cole Memo. In light of limited investigative and prosecutorial resources, the Cole Memo concluded that the DOJ should be focused on addressing only the most significant threats related to cannabis, such as distribution of cannabis from states where cannabis is legal to those where cannabis is illegal, the diversion of cannabis revenues to illicit drug cartels and sales of cannabis to minors. &#160; &#160;&#160; On January 4, 2018, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a new memorandum (the &#8220;Sessions Memo&#8221;) which rescinded the Cole Memo. The Sessions Memo stated, in part, that current law reflects &#8220;Congress&#8217; determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and cannabis activity is a serious crime,&#8221; and Mr. Sessions directed all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress by following well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to cannabis activities. The Company is not aware of any prosecutions of investment companies doing routine business with licensed marijuana related businesses in light of the DOJ position following issuance of the Sessions Memo. However, there can be no assurance that the federal government will not enforce federal laws relating to cannabis in the future. As a result of the Sessions Memo, federal prosecutors are now free to utilize their prosecutorial discretion to decide whether to prosecute cannabis activities, despite the existence of state-level laws that may be inconsistent with federal prohibitions. No direction was given to federal prosecutors in the Sessions Memo as to the priority they should ascribe to such cannabis activities, and thus it is uncertain how active U.S. federal prosecutors will be in relation to such activities. &#160; Federal prosecutors appear to continue to use the Cole Memo&#8217;s priorities as an enforcement guide. Merrick Garland, who became Attorney General on March 10, 2021, has indicated that he would deprioritize enforcement of low-level cannabis crimes such as possession, and has shared his view that the government should focus on large-scale criminal enterprises that circumvent state legalization laws instead of going after people who abide by local cannabis policies. The Company believes it is too soon to determine what prosecutorial effects will be created by the rescission of the Cole Memo or any replacement thereof and when or if the Sessions Memo will be rescinded. President Joseph R. Biden, who assumed office in January 2021, has not yet indicated whether and when he will decriminalize or legalize cannabis and has previously stated that he is opposed to legalization. The sheer size of the cannabis industry, in addition to participation by state and local governments and investors, suggests that a large-scale federal enforcement operation would more than likely create unwanted political backlash for the DOJ and the current administration. Regardless, at this time, cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level. The U.S. federal government has always reserved the right to enforce federal law regarding the sale and disbursement of medical or adult use cannabis, even if state law authorizes such sale and disbursement. It is unclear whether the risk of enforcement has been altered.&#160; One legislative safeguard for the medical cannabis industry, appended to the federal budget bill, remains in place following the rescission of the Cole Memo. For several years, Congress has adopted a so-called &#8220;rider&#8221; provision to the Consolidated Appropriations Act (formerly referred to as the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment and currently referred to as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment) to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal cannabis laws against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. Despite the rescission of the Cole Memo, the DOJ appears to continue to adhere to the enforcement priorities set forth in the Cole Memo.&#160; The Cole Memo and the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment gave licensed cannabis operators (particularly medical cannabis operators) and investors in states with legal regimes greater certainty regarding the DOJ&#8217;s enforcement priorities and the risk of operating cannabis businesses. While the Sessions Memo has introduced some uncertainty regarding federal enforcement, the cannabis industry continues to experience growth in legal medical and adult use markets across the United States. When she was a U.S. Senator, Vice President Kamala Harris was the lead sponsor of the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment, and Expungement (MORE) Act, which seeks to end the federal prohibition of marijuana, among other things, but in March 2020, it was reported that Vice President Harris has adopted the same position as President Biden, who opposes legalization. Currently, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will remain in place or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the U.S. Congress amends the CSA with respect to cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law criminalizing cannabis. &#160; Although the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that it is the federal government that has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, and federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana preempts state laws that legalize its use, cannabis is largely regulated at the state level. &#160;State laws that permit and regulate the production, distribution and use of cannabis for adult use or medical purposes are in direct conflict with the CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the U.S. authorize medical and\/or adult use cannabis production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under U.S. federal law, the possession, use, cultivation and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal, and any such acts are criminal acts under federal law under any and all circumstances under the CSA. Although the Company&#8217;s activities are believed to be compliant with applicable state and local laws, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under U.S. federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company. &#160; &#160;&#160; As of December 31, 2021, 37 states, plus the District of Columbia (and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands), have legalized the medical use of cannabis. In 18 of those states, the sale and possession of cannabis is legal for both medical and adult use, and the District of Columbia has legalized adult use but not commercial sale. Eleven other states have laws that limit THC content, for the purpose of allowing access to CBD products.&#160; We will continue to monitor compliance on an ongoing basis in accordance with our compliance program and standard operating procedures. While our operations are in full compliance with all applicable state laws, regulations and licensing requirements, such activities remain illegal under federal law. For the reasons described above and the risks further described in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC, there are significant risks associated with our business. &#160; Financial transactions involving proceeds generated by marijuana-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution under the federal money laundering statutes, unlicensed money transmitter statute and the Bank Secrecy Act. Previous guidance issued by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a division of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (&#8220;FinCEN&#8221;), clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Prior to the DOJ&#8217;s announcement in 2018 of the rescission of the Cole Memo and related memoranda, supplemental guidance from the DOJ directed federal prosecutors to consider the federal enforcement priorities enumerated in the Cole Memo when determining whether to charge institutions or individuals with any of the financial crimes described above based upon marijuana-related activity. &#160; Consequently, those businesses involved in the marijuana industry continue to encounter difficulty establishing banking relationships, which may increase over time. Our inability to maintain our current bank accounts would make it difficult for us to operate our business, increase our operating costs, and pose additional operational, logistical and security challenges and could result in our inability to implement our business plan. &#160; The inability of our current and potential tenants to open accounts and continue using the services of banks will limit their ability to enter into triple-net lease arrangements with us or may result in their default under our lease agreements, either of which could materially harm our business and the trading price of our securities. &#160; Local, state and federal marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our proposed business. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business. &#160; Employees &#160; As of December 31, 2021, we had four full-time employees, including our chief executive officer and chief operating officer, and multiple part-time employees who operate as independent contractors of the Company. We have established an extensive network of external partners, contractors, and consultants to which we outsource various operational tasks in an effort to minimize administrative overhead and maximize efficiency. &#160; &#160;&#160; ","14":" Item 1. &#160; BUSINESS OVERVIEW Citizens, Inc. (\"Citizens\" or the \"Company\") is an insurance holding company incorporated in Colorado serving the life insurance needs of individuals in the United States since 1969 and internationally since 1975. Through our insurance subsidiaries, we pursue a strategy of offering traditional insurance products in niche markets where we believe we are able to achieve competitive advantages. We had approximately $1.7 billion &#32;of assets at December 31, 2019 &#32;and approximately $4.2 billion &#32;of insurance in force. Our core insurance operations include: &#8226; U.S. dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies predominantly sold to foreign residents, located principally in Latin America and the Pacific Rim, through independent marketing consultants; &#8226; ordinary whole life insurance policies to middle income households concentrated in the Midwest, Mountain West and southern United States through independent marketing consultants; and &#8226; final expense and limited liability property policies to middle and lower income households in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas through employee and independent agents in our home service distribution channel and funeral homes. STRATEGIC INITIATIVES We are implementing our enduring value customer-centric growth strategy, in cooperation with our Board of Directors. In doing so, we are focused on our core strengths, as we strategically realign our Life and Home Service Insurance segments. We anticipate significant transformation with an emphasis on people, processes and technology. In our current operational environment, change is seen as a positive and is now taking root in our culture, creating the best atmosphere for value creation and value capture for all our stakeholders. As a result of the Company&#8217;s continued strategic review of its technology systems, we converted the ordinary whole life policies of Security Plan Life Insurance Company (\"SPLIC\") to a new actuarial valuation software solution that provides enhanced modeling capabilities as of July 1, 2019. This system conversion, which impacted the Home Service Insurance segment, resulted in changes in estimates due to refinements reflected as a decrease in policyholder benefit reserves of $2.3 million and a decrease in deferred acquisition costs of $1.4 million, before tax as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company reviews its investment strategies routinely to monitor the portfolio's rate of return as compared to the product features in our insurance policies and strive to maximize returns on our investment portfolio within our conservative investment guidelines. The Company is looking for opportunities in other asset classes to increase our yields while maintaining a prudent risk profile. The following pages describe the operations of our two business segments: Life Insurance and Home Service Insurance. CICA Life Insurance Company of America (\"CICA\"), CICA Life Ltd. (\"CICA Ltd.\") and Citizens National Life Insurance Company (\"CNLIC\") constitute the Life Insurance segment, and Security Plan Life Insurance Company (\"SPLIC\"), Security Plan Fire Insurance Company (\"SPFIC\") and Magnolia Guaranty Life Insurance Company (\"MGLIC\") constitute the Home Service Insurance segment. In addition to the Life Insurance and Home Service Insurance segments, the Company also has other non-insurance operations (\"Other Non-Insurance Enterprises\") which primarily include the Company's IT and Corporate-support functions. Citizens had over 400 employees as of December 31, 2019 , over half of which worked in the Home Service Segment. Revenues derived from any single customer did not exceed 10% of consolidated revenues in any of the last three years. For more information about the financial performance of our business segments, see Note 8. Segment and Other Operating Information &#32;of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;December 31, 2019 | 10-K 2 CITIZENS, INC. &#160; &#160; &#160; LIFE INSURANCE Our Life Insurance segment issues U.S. Dollar-denominated endowment contracts internationally, which are principally accumulation contracts that incorporate an element of life insurance protection, and ordinary whole life insurance in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts sold to foreign residents. These contracts are designed to provide a fixed amount of insurance coverage over the life of the insured and may utilize rider benefits to provide additional coverage and annuity benefits to enhance accumulations. For the majority of our business, we retain the first $0.1 million of risk on any one life, reinsuring the remainder of the risk. Historically we have operated this segment through our CICA and CNLIC insurance subsidiaries. Since July 1, 2018, we operate the novated international business in this segment through CICA Ltd. We operate our domestic business in this segment through CICA and CNLIC. INTERNATIONAL SALES We focus our sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies to residents in Latin America and the Pacific Rim. We have participated in the foreign marketplace since 1975. We believe positive attributes of our international insurance business typically include: &#8226; larger face amount policies issued when compared to our U.S. operations, which results in lower underwriting and administrative costs per unit of coverage; &#8226; premiums paid annually rather than monthly or quarterly, which reduces our administrative expenses, accelerates cash flow and results in lower policy lapse rates than premiums with more frequently scheduled payments; and &#8226; persistency experience and mortality rates that are comparable to U.S. policies. As of December 31, 2019 , we had insurance policies in force in almost 20 &#32;countries, including Colombia , Venezuela , Taiwan , Ecuador &#32;and Argentina &#32;as our top producing countries. International direct premiums comprised approximately 96% &#32;of total direct premiums in the Life Insurance segment and 71% &#32;of our total direct premiums in 2019 . Our independent marketing firms and consultants specialize in marketing life insurance products and generally have several years of insurance marketing experience. We maintain contracts with the independent marketing firms pursuant to which they provide recruitment, training and supervision of their managers and associates in the service and placement of our products. However, all associates of these firms also contract directly with us as independent contractors and receive their compensation directly from us. Accordingly, should an arrangement between any independent marketing firm and us be terminated for any reason, we expect we would seek to continue the existing marketing arrangements with the associates of these firms. Our agreements with independent marketing firms and consultants typically provide that they are independent contractors responsible for their own operational expenses and are the representative of the prospective insured. In addition, the marketing firms guarantee any debts of their associates to us. The marketing firms receive commissions on all new and renewal policies serviced or placed by them or their associates. All of these contracts provide that the independent marketing firms and consultants are aware of and responsible for compliance with local laws. INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTS We offer several ordinary whole life insurance and endowment products designed to meet the needs of our non-U.S. policyowners. These policies have been structured to provide: &#8226; U.S. Dollar-denominated cash values that accumulate, beginning in the first policy year, to a policyholder during his or her lifetime; &#8226; premium rates that are competitive with most foreign local companies; &#8226; a hedge against local currency inflation; &#8226; protection against devaluation of foreign currency; &#8226; capital investment in a more secure economic environment (i.e., the U.S.); and &#8226; lifetime income guarantees for an insured or for surviving beneficiaries. Our international products have living benefit features. Most policies contain guaranteed cash values and are participating (i.e., provide for cash dividends as apportioned by the Board). Once a policyowner pays the annual premium and the policy is issued, the owner becomes entitled to policy cash dividends as well as annual premium &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;December 31, 2019 | 10-K 3 CITIZENS, INC. &#160; &#160; &#160; benefits if the annual premium benefit was elected. According to the policy language, the policyowner has several options with regard to the policy dividends and annual premium benefits, which include, among other things, electing to receive cash, crediting such amounts towards the payment of premiums on the policy, leaving such amounts on deposit with the Company to accumulate at a defined interest rate or assigning them to a third-party. &#32;Under the \"assigned to a third-party\" provision, the Company has historically allowed policyowners, after receiving a copy of the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the \"CISIP\") prospectus and acknowledging their understanding of the risks of investing in Citizens Class A common stock, the right to assign policy values outside of the policy to the CISIP, which is administered in the United States by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., our plan administrator and an affiliate of Computershare, Inc., our transfer agent. The CISIP is a direct stock purchase plan available to policyowners, shareholders, our employees and directors, independent consultants, and other potential investors through the Computershare website. The Company has registered the shares of Class A common stock issuable to participants under the CISIP on a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") that is on file with the SEC. Computershare administers the CISIP in accordance with the terms and conditions of the CISIP, which is available on the Computershare website and as part of the Company&#8217;s registration statement on file with the SEC. In 2019, the Company repriced products sold internationally in response to the continued low interest rate environment in order to increase profits in our international markets. We also expect to expand distribution and will issue newly enhanced products in 2020. INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION The life insurance business is highly competitive. We compete with a number of stock and mutual life insurance companies internationally and domestically, as well as with financial institutions that offer insurance products. We face competition primarily from companies formed and operated in the country in which the insureds reside, from companies that operate in the same manner as we do and from companies that are foreign to the countries in which policies are sold, but issue insurance policies denominated in the local currency of those countries. Some companies may be deemed to have a competitive advantage over us due to their significantly greater financial resources, histories of successful operations and larger marketing forces. Because premiums on our international policies are paid in U.S. dollars, and we pay claims and benefits in U.S. dollars, we provide life insurance solutions that we believe are different from and superior to those offered by foreign-domiciled companies. We believe our international policies are usually acquired by individuals in the upper middle class in their respective countries and those with significant net worth and earnings that place them in the upper income brackets of their respective countries. The policies sold by our foreign competitors are generally offered broadly and are priced using the mortality of the entire population of the geographic region. Our mortality charges are typically lower due to our customer demographics, which provides a competitive advantage. Additionally, the assets backing the reserves for our foreign competitors' policies must be substantially invested in their respective countries and, therefore, are exposed to the inflationary risks and social or economic crises that have been more common in these foreign countries. DOMESTIC SALES In 2019 , domestic direct premiums comprised approximately 4% &#32;of total direct premiums in the Life Insurance segment and 3% &#32;of our total direct premiums overall. The majority of our domestic inforce business results from blocks of business of insurance companies we have acquired over the years. We discontinued new sales of our non-Home Service domestic ordinary whole life insurance and endowment products beginning January 1, 2017. Under the direction of our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Marketing Officer, we are evaluating our domestic strategy. &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;December 31, 2019 | 10-K 4 CITIZENS, INC. &#160; &#160; &#160; DOMESTIC LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS Our domestic life insurance products have historically focused primarily on living needs and provided benefits focused toward accumulating financial benefits for the policyowner. The features of our domestic life insurance products include: &#8226; cash accumulation\/living benefits; &#8226; tax-deferred interest earnings; &#8226; guaranteed lifetime income options; &#8226; monthly income for surviving family members; &#8226; accidental death benefit coverage options; and &#8226; an option to waive premium payments in the event of disability. Our life insurance products have historically been designed to address the insured's concern about outliving his or her monthly income, while at the same time providing death benefits. The primary purpose of our current product portfolio is to help the insured create capital for needs such as retirement income, children's higher education, business opportunities, emergencies and health care needs. In addition, our insurance products offer financial benefits like savings protection and immediate funds in event of the insureds death. &#160; HOME SERVICE INSURANCE Our domestic Home Service Insurance segment operates through our subsidiaries SPLIC, MGLIC and SPFIC, and focuses on the life insurance needs of the middle and lower income markets, primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas. Our policies are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system of 223 employee-agents who work on a route system and through over 221 &#32;funeral homes and independent agents who sell policies, collect premiums and service policyholders. To a lesser extent, our Home Service Insurance segment sells limited liability, named peril property policies covering dwelling and contents. In 2019 , our Home Service Insurance segment comprised 25% &#32;of our total direct premiums. HOME SERVICE PRODUCTS AND COMPETITION Our Home Service Insurance products consist primarily of small face amount ordinary whole life and pre-need policies, which are designed to fund final expenses for the insured, primarily funeral and burial costs. The average life insurance policy face amount issued in 2019 &#32;was approximately $7,200 . Due to the lower risk associated with small face amount polices, the underwriting performed on these applications is limited. Our property coverages are limited to $30,000 &#32;maximum coverage on any one dwelling and contents, while content-only coverage and dwelling-only coverage is limited to $20,000 . We face competition in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas from other companies specializing in home service insurance. We seek to compete based upon our emphasis on personal service to our customers. We intend to continue premium growth within this segment via direct sales. OTHER NON-INSURANCE ENTERPRISES Other Non-Insurance Enterprises includes the results of the parent company, Citizens, Inc., and Computing Technology, Inc., which provides data processing services to the Company. OPERATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY Our administrative operations principally serve our Life Insurance segment and are conducted primarily at our executive offices in Austin, Texas through 103 &#32;administrative, operating and underwriting personnel. Our Home Service business is conducted, to a large degree, from our district offices in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, as well as our service center in Donaldsonville, Louisiana. At our executive offices, we also perform policy design, marketing oversight, underwriting, accounting and reporting, actuarial, customer service, claims processing, administrative and investing activities. At our Bermuda office, we have 3 &#32;personnel that perform underwriting, policy issuance and claims processing related to CICA Ltd.'s international policies. We have a single integrated information technology system for our entire Company, which is a centrally-controlled, mainframe-based administrative system. Functions of our policy administrative system include policy set-up, administration, billing and collections, commission calculation, valuation, automated data edits, storage backup, image &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;December 31, 2019 | 10-K 5 CITIZENS, INC. &#160; &#160; &#160; management and other related functions. Each company we acquire has been converted onto our administrative system. This system has been in place for more than 30 years and has been updated on an ongoing basis as technology has evolved. We are currently reviewing technology options to transition from our legacy administration system to an upgraded, modernized technology platform that will service our policy administration needs into the future. We have outsourced the operations and maintenance of our legacy system that manages the administration and accounting of our current block of insurance contracts to a third-party provider. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT The Company has an enterprise risk management function (\"ERM\") that analyzes the Company&#8217;s risks on an individual and aggregated basis and is responsible for ensuring that the Company&#8217;s risks remain within its risk appetite and tolerances as determined by management with oversight from the Audit Committee. The Company's focus on ERM strengthens its risk management culture and discipline. The mission of ERM is to support the Company in achieving its strategic priorities by: &#8226; providing a comprehensive view of the risks facing the Company, including risk concentrations and correlations; &#8226; helping management define the Company&#8217;s overall capacity and appetite for risk by evaluating the risk return profile of the business relative to the Company&#8217;s strategic intent and financial underpinning; &#8226; assisting management in setting specific risk tolerances and limits that are measurable, actionable, and comply with the Company&#8217;s overall risk philosophy; &#8226; communicating and monitoring the Company&#8217;s risk exposures relative to set limits and recommending, or implementing as appropriate, mitigating strategies; and &#8226; providing insight to assist in growing the businesses and achieving optimal risk-adjusted returns within established guidelines. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE AND GOVERNANCE Effective risk oversight is an important priority for the Company&#8217;s Board and senior management team. While it is the job of the President and Chief Executive Officer and senior management to assess and manage the Company&#8217;s risk exposure through ERM, the Audit Committee of the Board is charged with discussing guidelines and policies to govern the process by which ERM is handled. The Audit Committee periodically discusses the Company&#8217;s major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The four broad categories of risk exposures assessed and managed by senior management include, but are not limited to: &#8226; Strategic risk, including international business risks; &#8226; Insurance risk, including those arising out of catastrophes and acts of terrorism; &#8226; Financial risk, including market, credit and liquidity risks; and &#8226; Operational risk, including cybersecurity risk and legal and regulatory compliance risks. In addition, any other risk that poses a material threat to the operational and\/or strategic viability of the Company is immediately reviewed and assessed. In addition to the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee considers the risks that may be presented by our executive compensation philosophy and programs, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the Company&#8217;s governance practices, director succession and committee composition and leadership to manage risks associated with corporate governance. Although risk oversight is conducted primarily through committees of the Board, the full Board has retained responsibility for general oversight of risks. The Board satisfies this responsibility through full reports by each committee chair regarding the committees&#8217; considerations and actions, as well as through regular reports directly from officers responsible for oversight of particular risks within the Company. &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;December 31, 2019 | 10-K 6 CITIZENS, INC. &#160; &#160; &#160; REGULATION Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the U.S. states and Bermuda. U.S. REGULATION Our U.S. insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations. State insurance laws establish supervisory agencies with broad regulatory authority to regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of each state in which they are licensed. In addition, U.S. laws, such as the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, are examples of U.S. regulations that affect our business. We are subject to comprehensive regulations under the USA Patriot Act and the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (\"BSA\") with respect to money laundering, as well as federal regulations regarding privacy and confidentiality. Our insurance products and thus our businesses also are affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws. &#160; The purpose of the laws and regulations that affect our insurance business is primarily to protect our insureds and not our stockholders. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. In addition, insurance regulatory authorities (including state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general) periodically make inquiries and regularly conduct examinations regarding compliance by us and our subsidiaries with insurance, and other laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance businesses. It is our practice to fully and consistently cooperate with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted. &#160; Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact business in 31 &#32;states and in the District of Columbia. We have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the states of Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are licensed and regulated in all U.S. jurisdictions in which they conduct insurance business. The extent of this regulation varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations based upon the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\") model rules governing the financial condition of insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentration of investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy, and the business conduct of insurers, including marketing and sales practices and claims handling. In addition, statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms and related materials and the approval of rates for certain types of insurance products. &#160; All U.S. jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries conduct insurance business have enacted legislation that requires each U.S. insurance company in a holding company system, except captive insurance companies, to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its jurisdiction of domicile and to furnish that regulatory authority with financial and other information concerning the operations of, and the interrelationships and transactions among, companies within its holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. These laws and regulations also regulate transactions between insurance companies and their parents and affiliates. Generally, these laws and regulations require that all transactions within a holding company system between an insurer and its affiliates be fair and reasonable and that the insurer's statutory capital and surplus following any transaction with an affiliate be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. For certain types of agreements and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates, these laws and regulations require prior notification to, and non-disapproval or approval by, the insurance regulatory authority of the insurer's jurisdiction of domicile. The payment of dividends or other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by the insurance laws and regulations of their respective state or jurisdiction of domicile. The laws and regulations of some of these jurisdictions also prohibit an insurer from declaring or paying a dividend except out of its earned surplus or require the insurer to obtain regulatory approval before it may do so. In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services) if they determine such payment could be adverse to policyholders or insurance contract holders of the subsidiary. &#160; &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;December 31, 2019 | 10-K 7 CITIZENS, INC. &#160; &#160; &#160; The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled require that a controlling party obtain the approval of the insurance commissioner of the insurance company's jurisdiction of domicile prior to acquiring control of the insurer and may delay, deter or prevent a transaction our shareholders might consider desirable. &#160; Risk-based capital (\"RBC\") requirements are imposed on life and property and casualty insurance companies. The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of RBC. RBC requirements weight the type of business underwritten by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called \"authorized control level risk-based capital\" and compares this level to adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves. Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of actions would be required by the affected company, including submitting a capital plan to the Department of Insurance in the insurance company's state of domicile. INTERNATIONAL REGULATION CICA Ltd., our Bermuda domiciled subsidiary, is subject to regulation and supervision by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the \"BMA\") and compliance with all applicable Bermuda law and Bermuda insurance statutes and regulations, including but not limited to Bermuda&#8217;s Insurance Act 1978 (the \"Insurance Act\"). CICA Ltd., which is incorporated to conduct long-term business, is registered as a Class E insurer, which is the license class for long-term insurers and reinsurers with total assets of more than $500 million that are not registrable as a single-parent or multi-owner long-term captive insurer or reinsurer. CICA Ltd. is not licensed to conduct any business other than an insurance business. The Insurance Act regulates the insurance business of CICA Ltd. and provides that no person may conduct any insurance business in or within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer under the Insurance Act by the BMA. The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards as well as auditing and reporting requirements and confers on the BMA powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. Certain requirements of the Insurance Act include: the filing of annual statutory financial returns; the filing of annual U.S. GAAP financial statements; the filing of an annual capital and solvency return; the delivery of a declaration of compliance; compliance with minimum enhanced capital requirements; compliance with the BMA&#8217;s Insurance Code of Conduct; compliance with minimum solvency margins; limitations on dividends and distributions that CICA Ltd. may make to Citizens, Inc., its parent company; preparation of an annual Financial Condition Report providing details of measures governing the business operations, corporate governance framework, solvency and financial performance; preparation of an assessment of an insurer's own risk and solvency requirements, referred to as a Commercial Insurer&#8217;s Solvency Self-Assessment; the establishment and maintenance of a head and principal office in Bermuda (with certain officers, a principal representative and a director to reside in Bermuda); appointment of an independent auditor; appointment of an actuary approved by the BMA; and compliance with restrictions on certain changes in control of regulated insurers. Bermuda&#8217;s regulatory regime provides a risk-based capital model, termed the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (&#8220;BSCR&#8221;), as a tool to assist the BMA both in measuring risk and in determining appropriate levels of capitalization. The BSCR employs a standard mathematical model that correlates the risk underwritten by Bermuda insurers to their capital. The BSCR framework applies a standard measurement format to the risk associated with an insurer's assets, liabilities and premiums, including a formula to take into account catastrophe risk exposure. The BMA established risk-based regulatory capital adequacy and solvency margin requirements for Bermuda insurers mandate that a Bermuda domiciled subsidiary&#8217;s Enhanced Capital Requirement (\"ECR\") be calculated by either (a) BSCR, or (b) an internal capital model which the BMA has approved for use for this purpose. CICA Ltd. uses the BSCR in calculating its solvency requirements. The Economic Balance Sheet (&#8220;EBS\") framework is embedded as part of the BSCR and forms the basis of our ECR. &#160; In order to minimize the risk of a shortfall in capital arising from an unexpected adverse deviation, and to facilitate the implementation of a risk-based capital approach, the BMA has established a threshold capital level (termed the Target Capital Level (\"TCL\")), set at 120% of ECR, that serves as an early warning tool for the BMA. Failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the TCL would likely result in increased BMA regulatory oversight. &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;December 31, 2019 | 10-K 8 CITIZENS, INC. &#160; &#160; &#160; Bermuda law distinguishes between those companies that are at least 60% owned and controlled by Bermudians, which are \"local companies\", and those which are owned and controlled by non-Bermudians, which are \"exempted companies\". Exempted companies may be resident in Bermuda and conduct business from Bermuda in connection with transactions and activities which are external to Bermuda or with other exempted companies, and exempted companies must obtain a license to conduct business activities within Bermuda from the Minister of Finance of Bermuda. Generally, it is not permitted without a special license granted by the Minister of Finance of Bermuda to insure Bermuda domestic risks or risks of persons of, in or based in Bermuda. In December 2018, the Economic Substance Act (the \"ES Act\") came into force. The ES Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, \"ES Law\"), apply to any \"relevant entity\" that conducts any \"relevant activity\" in a \"relevant financial period\". Under the provisions of the ES Law, a relevant entity that conducts a relevant activity must satisfy the economic substance requirements under the ES Law (the \"ES Requirements\") in relation to the relevant activity and where a relevant entity is conducting more than one relevant activity, it must meet the ES Requirements with respect to each relevant activity that it conducts. A relevant entity complies with the ES Requirements if: (a) the relevant entity is managed and directed from Bermuda; (b) the core income-generating activities are undertaken in Bermuda with respect to each relevant activity; (c) the relevant entity maintains adequate physical presence in Bermuda; (d) there are adequate full-time employees in Bermuda with suitable qualifications; and (e) there is adequate operating expenditure incurred in Bermuda in relation to each relevant activity. Under the ES Law, insurance and holding entities are each defined as a \"relevant activity\". CICA Ltd. will be required to demonstrate compliance with the ES Requirements by filing an annual economic substance declaration with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda no later than six months after the last day of the relevant financial period. Companies that conduct insurance as a relevant activity are deemed to comply with the ES Requirements, with respect to their insurance business, if they comply with the existing regulatory requirements under the Insurance Act 1978 and the corporate governance provisions of the Companies Act 1981. CICA Ltd. is in compliance with these requirements. Generally, all foreign countries in which we offer insurance products require a license or other authority to conduct insurance business in that country. Some of these countries also require that local regulatory authorities approve the terms of any insurance product sold to residents of that country. We have never qualified to do business in any foreign country or jurisdiction, except with respect to Bermuda, where CICA Ltd. is domiciled, and have never submitted our insurance policies issued to residents of foreign countries for approval by any foreign or domestic insurance regulatory agency. We sell our policies to residents of foreign countries using foreign independent marketing firms and independent consultants, and we rely on our independent consultants to comply with laws applicable to them in marketing our insurance products in their respective countries. We have undertaken a comprehensive compliance review of risks associated with the potential application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries. The application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries varies by country. There is a lack of uniform regulation, lack of clarity in certain regulations and lack of legal precedent in addressing circumstances similar to ours. Our compliance review has confirmed the previously disclosed risks related to foreign insurance laws associated with our current business model, at least in certain jurisdictions, as described in detail in Item 1A. Risk Factors &#32;- \"Risks Relating to our Business\". We are exploring alternatives to our current business model in one or more jurisdictions. ","15":" Item 1. Business. Introduction Donegal Group Inc., or DGI, is an insurance holding company whose insurance subsidiaries offer personal and commercial lines of property and casualty insurance to businesses and individuals in 20 Mid-Atlantic, Midwestern, New England and Southern states. As used in this Form 10-K Report, the terms &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us&#148; and &#147;our&#148; refer to Donegal Group Inc. and its subsidiaries. Our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbols &#147;DGICA&#148; and &#147;DGICB,&#148; respectively. Donegal Mutual Insurance Company, or Donegal Mutual, organized us as an insurance holding company on August 26, 1986. At December 31, 2019, Donegal Mutual held approximately 43% of our outstanding Class A common stock and approximately 84% of our outstanding Class B common stock. Donegal Mutual&#146;s ownership provides Donegal Mutual with approximately 71% of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock and our outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Our insurance subsidiaries and Donegal Mutual have interrelated operations due to an intercompany pooling agreement and other intercompany agreements and transactions we describe in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. While maintaining the separate corporate existence of each company, our insurance subsidiaries and Donegal Mutual conduct business together as the Donegal Insurance Group. As such, Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries share the same business philosophy, the same management, the same employees and the same facilities and offer the same types of insurance products. At December 31, 2019, we had three segments: our investment function, our commercial lines of insurance and our personal lines of insurance. We set forth financial information about these segments in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The commercial lines products of our insurance subsidiaries consist primarily of commercial automobile, commercial multi-peril and workers&#146; compensation policies. The personal lines products of our insurance subsidiaries consist primarily of homeowners and private passenger automobile policies. Our insurance subsidiaries and Donegal Mutual provide their policyholders with a selection of insurance products at competitive rates, while pursuing profitability by adhering to a strict underwriting discipline. Our insurance subsidiaries derive a substantial portion of their insurance business from smaller to mid-sized regional communities. We believe this focus provides our insurance subsidiaries with competitive advantages in terms of local market knowledge, marketing, underwriting, claims servicing and policyholder service. At the same time, we believe our insurance subsidiaries have cost advantages over many smaller regional insurers that result from economies of scale our insurance subsidiaries realize through centralized accounting, administrative, data processing, investment and other services. We believe we have a substantial opportunity, as a well-capitalized regional insurance holding company with a solid business strategy, to grow profitably and compete effectively with larger national property and casualty insurers. Our downstream holding company structure, with Donegal Mutual holding approximately 71% of the combined voting power of our common stock, has proven its effectiveness and success over the 33 years of our existence. Over that time period, we have grown significantly in terms of revenue and financial strength, and the Donegal Insurance Group has developed an excellent reputation as a regional group of property and casualty insurers. We have been an effective consolidator of smaller &#147;main street&#148; property and casualty insurance companies, and we pursue opportunities to acquire other insurance companies to expand our business in a given region. Since 1995, we have completed six acquisitions of property and casualty insurance companies or began to participate in their business through Donegal Mutual&#146;s entry into quota-share reinsurance agreements with them. In July 2018, we consolidated the branch office operations of Peninsula into our home office operations to achieve economies of scale and enhance service levels for policyholders of Peninsula. We recorded a restructuring charge for employee termination costs associated with the Peninsula consolidation of approximately $1.9 million and paid approximately $1.5 million of these costs in 2018. We paid approximately $260,000 of these costs in 2019 and had an accrual of approximately $130,000 remaining at December 31, 2019. We entered into a definitive purchase agreement for the sale of Peninsula&#146;s branch office in 2018. The sale was completed in January 2019, and we received net proceeds of $1.2 million. We recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million in other expenses in 2018 related to this real estate transaction and included the $1.2 million fair value of the real estate we held for sale in other assets at December 31, 2018. &#160;We and Donegal Mutual sold Donegal Financial Services Corporation (&#147;DFSC&#148;) to Northwest Bancshares, Inc. (&#147;Northwest&#148;) on March 8, 2019, resulting in proceeds valued at approximately $85.8 million in a combination of cash and Northwest common stock. Immediately prior to the closing of the merger, DFSC paid a dividend of approximately $29.2 million to us and Donegal Mutual. As the owner of 48.2% of DFSC&#146;s common stock, we received a dividend payment from DFSC of approximately $14.1 million and consideration from Northwest that included a combination of cash in the amount of $20.5 million and Northwest common stock with a fair value at the closing date of $20.9 million. We recorded a gain of $12.7 million from the sale of DFSC in our results of operations during 2019. We sold the Northwest common stock that we received as part of the consideration during 2019. This transaction represented the culmination of a banking strategy that began with the formation of DFSC in 2000. Effective December 1, 2019, our insurance subsidiaries Le Mars Insurance Company (&#147;Le Mars&#148;) and Sheboygan Falls Insurance Company (&#147;Sheboygan Falls&#148;) merged with and into Atlantic States (the &#147;Mergers&#148;). As a result of the Mergers, the separate corporate existences of Le Mars and Sheboygan Falls ceased and Atlantic States continued as the surviving insurance company. Atlantic States will place the business of Le Mars and Sheboygan Falls, as their policies renew subsequent to the effective date of the Mergers, into the underwriting pool.

History and Organizational Structure In the mid-1980&#146;s, Donegal Mutual, as a mutual insurance company, recognized the desirability of developing additional sources of capital and surplus so it could remain competitive and have the surplus to expand its business and ensure its long-term viability. Accordingly, Donegal Mutual determined to implement a downstream holding company structure as one of its business strategies. Thus, in 1986, Donegal Mutual formed us as a downstream holding company. After Donegal Mutual formed us, we in turn formed Atlantic States as our wholly owned property and casualty insurance company subsidiary. In connection with the formation of Atlantic States and the establishment of our downstream insurance holding company system, Donegal Mutual and Atlantic States entered into a proportional reinsurance agreement, or pooling agreement, that became effective October 1, 1986. Under the pooling agreement, Donegal Mutual and Atlantic States pool substantially all of their respective premiums, losses and loss expenses to the reinsurance pool, and the reinsurance pool, acting through Donegal Mutual, then cedes a portion of the pooled business, currently 80%, to Atlantic States. Donegal Mutual and Atlantic States share the underwriting results in proportion to their respective participation in the underwriting pool. Since we established Atlantic States in 1986, Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries have conducted business together as the Donegal Insurance Group. As the Donegal Insurance Group, Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries share a combined business plan to enhance market penetration and underwriting profitability objectives. We believe Donegal Mutual&#146;s majority interest in the combined voting power of our Class A common stock and of our Class B common stock fosters our ability to implement our business philosophies, enjoy management continuity, maintain superior employee relations and provide a stable environment within which we can grow our businesses. The products Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries offer are generally complementary, which permits the Donegal Insurance Group to offer a broad range of products in a given market and to expand the Donegal Insurance Group&#146;s ability to service an entire personal lines or commercial lines account. Distinctions within the products Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries offer generally relate to specific risk profiles within similar classes of business, such as preferred tier products versus standard tier products. Donegal Mutual and we do not allocate all of the standard risk gradients to one company. As a result, the underwriting profitability of the business the individual companies write directly will vary. However, the underwriting pool homogenizes the risk characteristics of all business Donegal Mutual and Atlantic States write directly. We receive 80% of the results of the underwriting pool because Atlantic States has an 80% participation in the pool. The &#160;business Atlantic States derives from the underwriting pool represents a significant percentage of our total consolidated revenues. However, that percentage has gradually decreased over the past few years as we have acquired a number of other property and casualty insurance companies that do not participate in the underwriting pool. As the capital of Atlantic States and our other insurance subsidiaries has increased, the underwriting capacity of our insurance subsidiaries has increased proportionately. The size of the underwriting pool has also increased substantially. Therefore, as we originally planned in the mid-1980s, Atlantic States has successfully raised the capital necessary to support the growth of its direct business as well as to accept increases in its allocation of business from the underwriting pool. The portion of the underwriting pool allocated to Atlantic States has increased from an initial allocation of 35% in 1986 to an 80% allocation since March 1, 2008. We do not anticipate any further change in the pooling agreement between Atlantic States and Donegal Mutual, including any change in the percentage participation of Atlantic States in the underwriting pool. In addition to Atlantic States, our insurance subsidiaries are Southern Insurance Company of Virginia, or Southern, The Peninsula Insurance Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Peninsula Indemnity Company, or collectively, Peninsula, and Michigan Insurance Company, or MICO. In addition, Donegal Mutual has a 100% quota-share reinsurance agreement with Southern Mutual Insurance Company, or Southern Mutual, and Donegal Mutual places its assumed business from Southern Mutual into the underwriting pool. Donegal Mutual completed the merger of Mountain States Mutual Casualty Company, or Mountain States, with and into Donegal Mutual effective May 25, 2017. Donegal Mutual was the surviving company in the merger, and Mountain States&#146; insurance subsidiaries, Mountain States Indemnity Company and Mountain States Commercial Insurance Company, became insurance subsidiaries of Donegal Mutual upon completion of the merger. Upon completion of the merger, Donegal Mutual assumed all of the policy obligations of Mountain States and began to market its products together with its insurance subsidiaries as the Mountain States Insurance Group in four Southwestern states. Donegal Mutual currently plans to place the business of the Mountain States Insurance Group into the underwriting pool beginning with policies effective in 2021. As a result, our consolidated financial results will exclude the results of Donegal Mutual&#146;s operations in those Southwestern states until Donegal Mutual places such business into the underwriting pool. The following chart depicts our organizational structure, including all of our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries and affiliates: &#160;&#160;&#160;(1) Because of the different relative voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock, our public stockholders hold approximately 29% of the combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock and Donegal Mutual holds approximately 71% of the combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock. &#160;Relationship with Donegal Mutual Donegal Mutual provides facilities, personnel and other services to us and our insurance subsidiaries. Donegal Mutual allocates certain related expenses to Atlantic States in relation to the relative participation of Donegal Mutual and Atlantic States in the underwriting pool they maintain. Our insurance subsidiaries other than Atlantic States reimburse Donegal Mutual for their respective personnel costs and bear their proportionate share of information services costs based on each subsidiaries&#146; respective percentage of the total net premiums written of the Donegal Insurance Group. Charges for these services to Atlantic States and our other insurance subsidiaries totaled $134.1 million, $126.2 million and $125.0 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our insurance subsidiaries have various reinsurance arrangements with Donegal Mutual. These agreements include: &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; a catastrophe reinsurance agreement with Atlantic States, MICO, Peninsula and Southern pursuant to which Donegal Mutual provides coverage for losses related to any catastrophic occurrence over a set retention of $2.0 million for each participating insurance subsidiary, with a combined retention of $5.0 million for a catastrophe involving a combination of participating insurance subsidiaries, up to the amount Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries retain under catastrophe reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurers; and &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; quota-share reinsurance agreements with MICO and Peninsula. The purpose of the catastrophe reinsurance agreement is to lessen the effects of an accumulation of losses arising from one event to levels that are appropriate given each subsidiary&#146;s size, underwriting profile and amount of surplus. The purpose of the quota-share reinsurance agreement with Peninsula is to transfer to Donegal Mutual 100% of the premiums and losses related to the workers&#146; compensation product line of Peninsula in certain states, which provides the availability of an additional workers&#146; compensation tier for Donegal Mutual&#146;s commercial accounts. Donegal Mutual places its assumed business from Peninsula into the underwriting pool. The purpose of the quota-share reinsurance agreement with MICO is to transfer to Donegal Mutual 25% of the premiums and losses related to MICO&#146;s business. Donegal Mutual places its assumed business from MICO into the underwriting pool. We and Donegal Mutual have maintained a coordinating committee since our formation in 1986. The coordinating committee consists of two members of our board of directors, neither of whom is a member of Donegal Mutual&#146;s board of directors, and two members of Donegal Mutual&#146;s board of directors, neither of whom is a member of our board of directors. The purpose of the coordinating committee is to establish and maintain a process for an annual evaluation of the transactions between Donegal Mutual, our insurance subsidiaries and us. The coordinating committee considers the fairness of each intercompany transaction to Donegal Mutual and its policyholders and to us and our stockholders. A new agreement or any change to a previously approved agreement must receive coordinating committee approval. The approval process for a new agreement between Donegal Mutual and us or one of our insurance subsidiaries or a change in such an agreement is as follows: &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; both of our members on the coordinating committee must determine that the new agreement or the change in an existing agreement is fair and equitable to us and in the best interests of our stockholders; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; both of Donegal Mutual&#146;s members on the coordinating committee must determine that the new agreement or the change in an existing agreement is fair and equitable to Donegal Mutual and in the best interests of its policyholders; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; our board of directors must approve the new agreement or the change in an existing agreement; and &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; Donegal Mutual&#146;s board of directors must approve the new agreement or the change in an existing agreement. The coordinating committee also meets annually to review each existing agreement between Donegal Mutual and us or our insurance subsidiaries, including all reinsurance agreements between Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries. The purpose of this annual review is to examine the results of the agreements over the past year and, in the case of reinsurance agreements, over several years and to determine if the results of the existing agreements remain fair and equitable to us and our &#160;stockholders and fair and equitable to Donegal Mutual and its policyholders or if Donegal Mutual and we should mutually agree to certain adjustments to the terms of the agreements. In the case of these reinsurance agreements, the annual adjustments typically relate to the reinsurance premiums, losses and reinstatement premiums. These agreements are ongoing in nature and will continue in effect throughout 2020 in the ordinary course of our business. Our members on the coordinating committee, as of the date of this Form 10-K Report, are Robert S. Bolinger and Richard D. Wampler, II. Donegal Mutual&#146;s members on the coordinating committee as of such date are Michael W. Brubaker and Cyril J. Greenya. We refer to our proxy statement for our annual meeting of stockholders to be held on April 16, 2020 for further information about the members of the coordinating committee. We believe our relationships with Donegal Mutual offer us and our insurance subsidiaries a number of competitive advantages, including the following: &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; enabling our stable management, the consistent underwriting discipline of our insurance subsidiaries, external growth, long-term profitability and financial strength; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; creating operational and expense synergies from the combination of resources and integrated operations of Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; producing more stable and uniform underwriting results for our insurance subsidiaries over extended periods of time than we could achieve without our relationship with Donegal Mutual; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; providing opportunities for growth because of the ability of Donegal Mutual to affiliate and enter into reinsurance agreements with, or otherwise acquire control of, mutual insurance companies and place the business it assumes into the underwriting pool; and &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; providing Atlantic States with a significantly larger underwriting capacity because of the underwriting pool Donegal Mutual and Atlantic States have maintained since 1986. In the first quarter of 2020, our board of directors and the board of directors of Donegal Mutual each undertook a review of the relationships between Donegal Mutual and DGI and determined that continuing the current relationships and the current corporate structure of Donegal Mutual and DGI is in the best interests of DGI and its various constituencies. Business Strategy Our strategy is designed to allow our insurance subsidiaries to achieve their longstanding goal of outperforming the United States property and casualty insurance industry in terms of profitability and service, thereby providing value to the policyholders of our insurance subsidiaries and, ultimately, providing value to our stockholders. The annual net premiums earned of our insurance subsidiaries have increased from $301.5 million in 2006 to $756.1 million in 2019, a compound annual growth rate of 7.3%. The combined ratio of our insurance subsidiaries and that of the United States property and casualty insurance industry as computed using United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and statutory accounting principles, or SAP, for the years 2015 through 2019 are shown in the following table: &#160;&#160; &#160; 2019 &#160; &#160; 2018 &#160; &#160; 2017 &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; Our GAAP combined ratio&#160; &#160; 99.5 % &#160; &#160; 110.1 % &#160; &#160; 103.0 % &#160; &#160; 98.1 % &#160; &#160; 99.0 % Our SAP combined ratio&#160; &#160; 98.7 &#160; &#160; &#160; 109.4 &#160; &#160; &#160; 101.7 &#160; &#160; &#160; 96.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; 97.4 &#160; Industry SAP combined ratio (1) &#160; &#160; 98.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; 99.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 105.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100.9 &#160; &#160; &#160; 98.3 &#160; &#160;(1) As reported (projected for 2019) by A.M. Best Company. We and Donegal Mutual believe we can continue to expand our insurance operations over time through organic growth and acquisitions of, or affiliations with, other insurance companies. We and Donegal Mutual have enhanced the performance of companies we have acquired, while leveraging the acquired companies&#146; core strengths and local market knowledge to expand their operations. Our insurance subsidiaries and Donegal Mutual also seek to increase their premium base by making quality independent agency appointments, enhancing their competitive position within each agency, introducing new and enhanced insurance products and developing and maintaining automated systems to improve service, communications and efficiency. &#160;A detailed review of our business strategies follows: &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; Achieving underwriting profitability. Our insurance subsidiaries seek to achieve a combined ratio of less than 100%. We remain committed to achieving consistent underwriting profitability. Underwriting profitability is a fundamental component of our long-term financial strength because it allows our insurance subsidiaries to generate profits without relying exclusively on their investment income for profitability. Our insurance subsidiaries seek to enhance their underwriting results by: &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; carefully selecting the product lines they underwrite; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; carefully selecting the individual risks they underwrite; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; minimizing their individual exposure to catastrophe-prone areas; and &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; evaluating their claims history on a regular basis to ensure the adequacy of their underwriting guidelines and product pricing. Our insurance subsidiaries have no material exposures to asbestos or environmental liabilities. Our insurance subsidiaries seek to provide more than one policy to a given personal lines or commercial lines customer because this &#147;account selling&#148; strategy diversifies their risk and has historically improved their underwriting results. Our insurance subsidiaries also use reinsurance to manage their exposure and limit their maximum net loss from large single risks or risks in concentrated areas. &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; Pursuing profitable growth by organic expansion within the traditional operating territories of our insurance subsidiaries through developing and maintaining quality agency representation. Continued expansion of our insurance subsidiaries within their existing markets will be a key source of their continued premium growth, and maintaining an effective and growing network of independent agencies is integral to this expansion. Our insurance subsidiaries seek to be among the top three insurers within each of the independent agencies for the lines of business our insurance subsidiaries write by providing a consistent, competitive and stable market for their products. We believe that the consistency of the product offerings of our insurance subsidiaries enables our insurance subsidiaries to compete effectively for independent agents with other insurers whose product offerings may fluctuate based on industry conditions. Our insurance subsidiaries offer a competitive compensation program to their independent agents that rewards them for producing profitable growth for our insurance subsidiaries. Our insurance subsidiaries provide their independent agents with ongoing support to enable them to better attract and service customers, including: &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; fully automated underwriting and policy issuance systems for commercial and personal lines of insurance; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; training programs; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; marketing support; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; availability of a service center that provides comprehensive service for our policyholders; and &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; field visitations by marketing and underwriting personnel and senior management of our insurance subsidiaries. Our insurance subsidiaries appoint independent agencies with a strong underwriting and growth track record. We believe that our insurance subsidiaries, by carefully selecting, motivating and supporting their independent agencies, will drive continued long-term growth. &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; Acquiring property and casualty insurance companies to augment the organic growth of our insurance subsidiaries. We have been an effective consolidator of smaller &#147;main street&#148; property and casualty insurance companies, and we expect to continue to acquire other insurance companies to expand our business in a given region over time. &#160;Since 1995, we have completed six acquisitions of property and casualty insurance companies or participated in their business through Donegal Mutual&#146;s entry into quota-share reinsurance agreements with them. We intend to continue our growth by pursuing affiliations and acquisitions that meet our criteria. Our primary criteria are: &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; location in regions where our insurance subsidiaries are currently conducting business or that offer an attractive opportunity to conduct profitable business; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; a mix of business similar to the mix of business of our insurance subsidiaries; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; annual premium volume between $50.0 million to $100.0 million; and &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; fair and reasonable transaction terms. We believe that our relationship with Donegal Mutual assists us in pursuing affiliations with, and subsequent acquisitions of, mutual insurance companies because, through Donegal Mutual, we understand the concerns and issues that mutual insurance companies face. In particular, Donegal Mutual has had success affiliating with underperforming mutual insurance companies, and we have either acquired them following their conversion to a stock company or benefited from their underwriting results as a result of Donegal Mutual&#146;s entry into a 100% quota-share reinsurance agreement with them and placement of that assumed business into the pooling agreement. We have utilized our strengths and financial position to improve the operations of those underperforming insurance companies. We evaluate a number of areas for operational synergies when considering acquisitions, including product underwriting, expenses, the cost of reinsurance and technology. We and Donegal Mutual have the ability to employ a number of acquisition and affiliation methods. Our prior acquisitions and affiliations have taken one of the following forms: &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; purchase of all of the outstanding stock of a stock insurance company; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; purchase of a book of business; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; quota-share reinsurance transaction; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; merger of a mutual company into Donegal Mutual; or &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; two-step acquisition of a mutual insurance company in which: &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; as the first step, Donegal Mutual purchases a surplus note from the mutual insurance company, Donegal Mutual enters into a services agreement with the mutual insurance company and Donegal Mutual&#146;s designees become a majority of the members of the board of directors of the mutual insurance company; and &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; as the second step, the mutual insurance company enters into a quota-share reinsurance agreement with Donegal Mutual or demutualizes, or converts, into a stock insurance company. Upon the demutualization or conversion, we purchase the surplus note from Donegal Mutual and exchange it for all of the stock of the stock insurance company resulting from the demutualization or conversion. We believe that our ability to make direct acquisitions of stock insurance companies and to make indirect acquisitions of mutual insurance companies through a sponsored conversion or a quota-share reinsurance agreement provides us with flexibility that is a competitive advantage in making acquisitions. We also believe our historic record demonstrates our ability to acquire control of an underperforming insurance company, re-underwrite its book of business, reduce its cost structure and return it to sustained profitability. While Donegal Mutual and we generally engage in preliminary discussions with potential direct or indirect acquisition candidates from time to time, neither Donegal Mutual nor we make any public disclosure regarding a proposed acquisition until Donegal Mutual or we have entered into a definitive acquisition agreement. &#160;The following table highlights our and Donegal Mutual&#146;s history of insurance company acquisitions and affiliations since 1988: &#160;Company Name &#160; State of Domicile &#160; Year Control Acquired &#160; Method of Acquisition\/Affiliation Southern Mutual Insurance Company and now Southern Insurance Company of Virginia&#160; Virginia &#160; 1984 &#160; Surplus note investment by Donegal Mutual in 1984; demutualization in 1988; acquisition of stock by us in 1988. Pioneer Mutual Insurance Company and then Pioneer Insurance Company (1)(2) &#160; Ohio &#160; 1992 &#160; Surplus note investment by Donegal Mutual in 1992; demutualization in 1993; acquisition of stock by us in 1997. Delaware Mutual Insurance Company and then Delaware Atlantic Insurance Company (1)(2) &#160; Delaware &#160; 1993 &#160; Surplus note investment by Donegal Mutual in 1993; demutualization in 1994; acquisition of stock by us in 1995. Pioneer Mutual Insurance Company and then Pioneer Insurance Company (1)(2) &#160; New York &#160; 1995 &#160; Surplus note investment by Donegal Mutual in 1995; demutualization in 1998; acquisition of stock by us in 2001. Southern Heritage Insurance Company (2) &#160; Georgia &#160; 1998 &#160; Purchase of stock by us in 1998. Le Mars Mutual Insurance Company of Iowa and then Le Mars Insurance Company (1)(2) &#160; Iowa &#160; 2002 &#160; Surplus note investment by Donegal Mutual in 2002; demutualization in 2004; acquisition of stock by us in 2004. Peninsula Insurance Group&#160; Maryland &#160; 2004 &#160; Purchase of stock by us in 2004. Sheboygan Falls Mutual Insurance Company and then Sheboygan Falls Insurance Company (1)(2) &#160; Wisconsin &#160; 2007 &#160; Contribution note investment by Donegal Mutual in 2007; demutualization in 2008; acquisition of stock by us in 2008. Southern Mutual Insurance Company (3) &#160; Georgia &#160; 2009 &#160; Surplus note investment by Donegal Mutual and quota-share reinsurance in 2009. Michigan Insurance Company&#160; Michigan &#160; 2010 &#160; Purchase of stock by us and surplus note investment by Donegal Mutual in 2010. Mountain States Mutual Casualty Company (4) &#160; New Mexico &#160; 2017 &#160; Merger with and into Donegal Mutual in 2017 &#160;&#160;(1) Each of these acquisitions initially took the form of an affiliation with Donegal Mutual. Donegal Mutual provided surplus note financing to the insurance company, and, in connection with that financing, sufficient designees of Donegal Mutual were appointed so as to constitute a majority of the members of the board of directors of the insurance company. Donegal Mutual and the insurance company simultaneously entered into a services agreement whereby Donegal Mutual provided services to improve the operations of the insurance company. Once the insurance company&#146;s results of operations improved to the satisfaction of Donegal Mutual, Donegal Mutual sponsored the demutualization of the insurance company. Upon the consummation of the demutualization, Donegal Mutual converted the surplus note to capital stock of the newly demutualized insurance company. We then purchased all of the capital stock of the insurance company from Donegal Mutual and made an additional capital contribution in cash to provide adequate surplus to support the insurance company&#146;s planned premium growth. (2) To reduce administrative and compliance costs and expenses, these subsidiaries subsequently merged into one of our existing insurance subsidiaries. (3) Control acquired by Donegal Mutual. (4) Donegal Mutual completed the merger of Mountain States with and into Donegal Mutual effective May 25, 2017. Donegal Mutual was the surviving company in the merger, and Mountain States&#146; insurance subsidiaries, Mountain States Indemnity Company and Mountain States Commercial Insurance Company, became insurance subsidiaries of Donegal Mutual upon completion of the merger. Upon completion of the merger, Donegal Mutual assumed all of the policy obligations of Mountain States and began to market its products together with its insurance subsidiaries as the Mountain States Insurance Group in four Southwestern states. Donegal Mutual currently plans to place the business of the Mountain States Insurance Group into the underwriting pool beginning with policies effective in 2021. As a result, our consolidated financial results will exclude the results of Donegal Mutual&#146;s operations in those Southwestern states until Donegal Mutual places such business into the underwriting pool. &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; Providing responsive and friendly customer and agent service to enable our insurance subsidiaries to attract new policyholders and retain existing policyholders. We believe that excellent policyholder service is important in attracting new policyholders and retaining existing policyholders. Our insurance subsidiaries work closely with their independent agents to provide a consistently responsive level of claims service, underwriting and customer support. Our insurance subsidiaries seek to respond expeditiously and effectively to address customer and independent agent inquiries in a number of ways, including: &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; availability of a customer call center, secure website and mobile application for claims reporting; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; availability of a secure website and mobile application for access to policy information and documents, payment processing and other features; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; timely replies to information requests and policy submissions; and &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; prompt responses to, and processing of, claims. Our insurance subsidiaries periodically conduct policyholder surveys to evaluate the effectiveness of their service to policyholders. The management of our insurance subsidiaries meets on a regular basis with the personnel of the independent insurance agents our insurance subsidiaries appoint to seek service improvement recommendations, react to service issues and better understand local market conditions. &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; Maintaining premium rate adequacy to enhance the underwriting results of our insurance subsidiaries, while maintaining their existing book of business and preserving their ability to write new business. Our insurance subsidiaries maintain discipline in their pricing by effecting rate increases to sustain or improve their underwriting results without unduly affecting their customer retention. In addition to appropriate pricing, our insurance subsidiaries seek to ensure that their premium rates are adequate relative to the amount of risk they insure. Our insurance subsidiaries review loss trends on a regular basis to identify changes in the frequency and severity of their claims and to assess the adequacy of their rates and underwriting standards. Our insurance subsidiaries also carefully monitor and audit the information they use to price their policies for the purpose of enabling them to receive an adequate level of premiums for the risk they assume. For example, our insurance subsidiaries audit the payroll data of their workers&#146; compensation customers to verify that the assumptions used to price a particular policy were accurate. By implementing appropriate rate increases and understanding the risks our insurance subsidiaries agree to insure, our insurance subsidiaries seek to achieve consistent underwriting profitability. &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; Focusing on expense controls and utilization of technology to increase the operating efficiency of our insurance subsidiaries. Our insurance subsidiaries maintain stringent expense controls under direct supervision of their senior management. We centralize the processing and administrative activities of our insurance subsidiaries to realize operating synergies and better expense control. Our insurance subsidiaries utilize technology to automate much of their underwriting and to facilitate agency and policyholder communications on an efficient, timely and cost-effective basis. Our insurance subsidiaries have increased their annual premium per employee, a measure of efficiency that our insurance subsidiaries use to evaluate their operations, from approximately $470,000 in 1999 to approximately $1.1 million in 2019. Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries strive to maintain technology comparable to that of their larger competitors. &#147;Ease of doing business&#148; is an increasingly important component of an insurer&#146;s value to an independent agency. Our insurance subsidiaries provide fully automated underwriting and policy issuance systems that substantially ease data entry and facilitate the quoting and issuance of policies for the independent agents of our insurance subsidiaries. As a result, applications of the independent agents for our insurance subsidiaries can result in policy issuance without further re-entry of information. These systems also interface with the policy management systems of the independent agents of our insurance subsidiaries. &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; Maintaining a conservative investment approach. Return on invested assets is an important element of the financial results of our insurance subsidiaries. The investment strategy of our insurance subsidiaries is to generate an appropriate amount of after-tax income on invested assets while minimizing credit risk through investments in high-quality securities. As a result, our insurance subsidiaries seek to invest a high percentage of their assets in diversified, highly rated and marketable fixed-maturity instruments. The fixed-maturity &#160;portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries consist of both taxable and tax-exempt securities. Our insurance subsidiaries maintain a portion of their portfolios in short-term securities to provide liquidity for the payment of claims and operation of their respective businesses. Our insurance subsidiaries maintain a small percentage (5.0% at December 31, 2019) of their portfolios in equity securities. Competition The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service. Numerous companies compete for business in the geographic areas where our insurance subsidiaries operate. Many of these other insurance companies are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than those of our insurance subsidiaries. In addition, because our insurance subsidiaries and Donegal Mutual market their respective insurance products exclusively through independent insurance agencies, most of which represent more than one insurance company, our insurance subsidiaries face competition within agencies, as well as competition to retain qualified independent agents. Products and Underwriting We report the results of our insurance operations in two segments: commercial lines of insurance and personal lines of insurance. The commercial lines our insurance subsidiaries write consist primarily of commercial automobile, commercial multi-peril and workers&#146; compensation insurance. The personal lines our insurance subsidiaries write consist primarily of private passenger automobile and homeowners insurance. We describe these lines of insurance in greater detail below: Commercial &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; Commercial automobile &#151; policies that provide protection against liability for bodily injury and property damage arising from automobile accidents and protection against loss from damage to automobiles owned by the insured. &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; Commercial multi-peril &#151; policies that provide protection to businesses against many perils, usually combining liability and physical damage coverages. &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; Workers&#146; compensation &#151; policies employers purchase to provide benefits to employees for injuries sustained during employment. The workers&#146; compensation laws of each state determine the extent of the coverage we provide. Personal &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; Private passenger automobile &#151; policies that provide protection against liability for bodily injury and property damage arising from automobile accidents and protection against loss from damage to automobiles owned by the insured. &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; Homeowners &#151; policies that provide coverage for damage to residences and their contents from a broad range of perils, including fire, lightning, windstorm and theft. These policies also cover liability of the insured arising from injury to other persons or their property while on the insured&#146;s property and under other specified conditions. &#160;In recent years, we have taken actions to shift our business mix to a higher proportion of commercial business, where we believe we have greater opportunities to achieve profitable, sustainable long-term growth. The following table sets forth the net premiums written of our insurance subsidiaries by line of insurance for the periods indicated: &#160;&#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2019 &#160; &#160; 2018 &#160; &#160; 2017 &#160; (dollars in thousands) &#160; Amount &#160; &#160; % &#160; &#160; Amount &#160; &#160; % &#160; &#160; Amount &#160; &#160; % &#160; Commercial lines:&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Automobile&#160; $ 122,142 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16.2 % &#160; $ 108,123 &#160; &#160; &#160; 14.5 % &#160; $ 99,333 &#160; &#160; &#160; 13.6 % Workers&#146; compensation&#160; &#160; 113,684 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 109,022 &#160; &#160; &#160; 14.7 &#160; &#160; &#160; 109,884 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15.1 &#160; Commercial multi-peril&#160; &#160; 138,750 &#160; &#160; &#160; 18.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; 117,509 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; 110,313 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15.1 &#160; Other&#160; &#160; 30,303 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15,241 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9,586 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.3 &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; Total commercial lines&#160; &#160; 404,879 &#160; &#160; &#160; 53.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; 349,895 &#160; &#160; &#160; 47.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 329,116 &#160; &#160; &#160; 45.1 &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; Personal lines:&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Automobile&#160; &#160; 210,507 &#160; &#160; &#160; 28.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 249,275 &#160; &#160; &#160; 33.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; 255,297 &#160; &#160; &#160; 35.0 &#160; Homeowners&#160; &#160; 117,118 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; 123,782 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 125,054 &#160; &#160; &#160; 17.2 &#160; Other&#160; &#160; 20,097 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.7 &#160; &#160; &#160; 21,064 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.9 &#160; &#160; &#160; 19,672 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.7 &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; Total personal lines&#160; &#160; 347,722 &#160; &#160; &#160; 46.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; 394,121 &#160; &#160; &#160; 53.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 400,023 &#160; &#160; &#160; 54.9 &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; Total business&#160; $ 752,601 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; $ 744,016 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; $ 729,139 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; The commercial lines and personal lines underwriting departments of our insurance subsidiaries evaluate and select those risks that they believe will enable our insurance subsidiaries to achieve an underwriting profit. The underwriting departments have significant interaction with the independent agents regarding the underwriting philosophy and the underwriting guidelines of our insurance subsidiaries. Our underwriting personnel also assist in the development of quality products at competitive prices to promote growth and profitability. We formally established an enterprise analytics function in early 2019. Our enterprise analytics team is responsible for core functions of ratemaking, predictive analytics, data governance and business intelligence. Those responsibilities include the development and expansion of risk-based pricing segmentation, analytical innovation, predictive modeling solutions, formal data strategies, performance monitoring and enhanced reporting mechanisms. In order to achieve underwriting profitability on a consistent basis, our insurance subsidiaries: &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; assess and select primarily standard and preferred risks; &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; adhere to disciplined underwriting guidelines; and &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; utilize various types of risk management and loss control services. Our insurance subsidiaries also review their existing policies and accounts to determine whether those risks continue to meet their underwriting guidelines. If a given policy or account no longer meets those underwriting guidelines, our insurance subsidiaries will take appropriate action regarding that policy or account, including raising premium rates or non-renewing the policy to the extent applicable law permits. As part of the effort of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain acceptable underwriting results, they conduct annual reviews of agencies that have failed to meet their underwriting profitability criteria. The review process includes an analysis of the underwriting and re-underwriting practices of the agency, the completeness and accuracy of the applications the agency submits, the adequacy of the training of the agency&#146;s staff and the agency&#146;s record of adherence to the underwriting guidelines and service standards of our insurance subsidiaries. Based on the results of this review process, the marketing and underwriting personnel of our insurance subsidiaries develop, together with the agency, a plan to improve its underwriting profitability. Our insurance subsidiaries monitor the agency&#146;s compliance with the plan and take other measures as required in the judgment of our insurance subsidiaries, including the termination to the extent applicable law permits of agencies that are unable to achieve acceptable underwriting profitability. &#160;Distribution Our insurance subsidiaries market their products primarily in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwestern, New England and Southern regions through approximately 2,400 independent insurance agencies. At December 31, 2019, the Donegal Insurance Group actively wrote business in 20 states (Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin). Donegal Mutual and its subsidiaries also write business in four Southwestern states (Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Utah). Donegal Mutual currently excludes the business written in these four states from the pooling agreement between Donegal Mutual and Atlantic States. As a result, this business has no impact on our results of operations. We believe the relationships of our insurance subsidiaries with their independent agents are valuable in identifying, obtaining and retaining profitable business. Our insurance subsidiaries maintain a stringent agency selection procedure that emphasizes appointing agencies with proven marketing strategies for the development of profitable business, and our insurance subsidiaries only appoint agencies with a strong underwriting history and potential growth capabilities. Our insurance subsidiaries also regularly evaluate the independent agencies that represent them based on their profitability and performance in relation to the objectives of our insurance subsidiaries. Our insurance subsidiaries seek to be among the top three insurers within each of their agencies for the lines of business our insurance subsidiaries write. The following table sets forth the percentage of direct premiums our insurance subsidiaries write, including 80% of the direct premiums Donegal Mutual and Atlantic States include in the underwriting pool, in each of the states where they conducted a significant portion of their business in 2019: &#160;Pennsylvania&#160; &#160; 35.3 % Michigan&#160; &#160; 15.8 &#160; Maryland&#160; &#160; 9.3 &#160; Georgia&#160; &#160; 8.0 &#160; Virginia&#160; &#160; 7.6 &#160; Delaware&#160; &#160; 6.2 &#160; Wisconsin&#160; &#160; 3.3 &#160; Ohio&#160; &#160; 3.1 &#160; Tennessee&#160; &#160; 2.2 &#160; Iowa&#160; &#160; 2.2 &#160; Other&#160; &#160; 7.0 &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; Total&#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; Our insurance subsidiaries employ a number of policies and procedures that we believe enable them to attract, retain and motivate their independent agents. We believe that the consistency of the product offerings of our insurance subsidiaries enables our insurance subsidiaries to compete effectively for independent agents with other insurers whose product offerings may fluctuate based upon industry conditions. Our insurance subsidiaries have a competitive profit-sharing plan for their independent agents, consistent with applicable state laws and regulations, under which the independent agents may earn additional commissions based upon the volume of premiums produced and the profitability of the business our insurance subsidiaries receive from that agency. Our insurance subsidiaries encourage their independent agents to focus on &#147;account selling,&#148; or serving all of a particular insured&#146;s property and casualty insurance needs, which our insurance subsidiaries believe generally results in more favorable loss experience than covering a single risk for an individual insured. Technology Donegal Mutual owns the technology systems our insurance subsidiaries use. The technology systems consist primarily of an integrated central processing computer system, a series of server-based computer networks and various communication systems that allow the home office and branch offices of Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries to utilize the same systems for the processing of business. Donegal Mutual maintains backup facilities and systems at the office of one of our insurance subsidiaries and tests these backup facilities and systems on a regular basis. Our insurance subsidiaries bear their proportionate share of information services expenses based on their respective percentage of the total net premiums written of the Donegal Insurance Group during the preceding calendar year. &#160;The business strategy of our insurance subsidiaries depends on the use, development and implementation of integrated technology systems. These systems enable our insurance subsidiaries to provide quality service to agents and policyholders by processing business in a timely and efficient manner, communicating and sharing data with agents, providing a variety of methods for the payment of premiums and allowing for the accumulation and analysis of information for the management of our insurance subsidiaries. We believe the availability and use of these technology systems has resulted in improved service to agents and policyholders, increased efficiencies in processing the business of our insurance subsidiaries and lower operating costs. Key components of these integrated technology systems are the agency interface system, the automated underwriting and policy issuance systems, a claims processing system and an imaging system. The agency interface system provides our insurance subsidiaries with a high level of data sharing both to and from agents&#146; systems and also provides agents with an integrated means of processing new business. The automated underwriting and policy issuance systems provide agents with the ability to generate underwritten quotes and automatically issue policies that meet the underwriting guidelines of our insurance subsidiaries with limited or no intervention by their personnel. The claims processing system allows our insurance subsidiaries to process claims efficiently and in an automated environment. The imaging system eliminates the need to handle paper files, while providing greater access to the same information by a variety of personnel. We believe our agency-facing technology systems compare favorably to those of many national property and casualty insurance carriers in terms of quality and service levels. In 2018, Donegal Mutual initiated a multi-year systems modernization project that will facilitate the replacement of its remaining legacy systems, streamline our business processes and workflows and enhance our data analytics and modeling capabilities. In February 2020, Donegal Mutual implemented the first release of new systems related to the project, and our insurance subsidiaries will issue workers&#146; compensation policies from the new systems beginning with new policies effective in May 2020 and renewal policies effective in June 2020. Over the next several years, Donegal Mutual expects to implement new systems for the remaining lines of business Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries offer currently. Claims The management of claims is a critical component of the philosophy of our insurance subsidiaries to achieve underwriting profitability on a consistent basis and is fundamental to the successful operations of our insurance subsidiaries and their dedication to excellent service. Our senior claims management oversees the claims processing units of each of our insurance subsidiaries to assure consistency in the claims settlement process. The field office staff of our insurance subsidiaries receives support from home office technical, litigation, material damage, subrogation and medical audit personnel. The claims departments of our insurance subsidiaries rigorously manage claims to assure that they settle legitimate claims quickly and fairly and that they identify questionable claims for defense. In the majority of cases, the personnel of our insurance subsidiaries, who have significant experience in the property and casualty insurance industry and know the service philosophy of our insurance subsidiaries, adjust claims. Our insurance subsidiaries provide various means of claims reporting on a 24-hours a day, seven-days a week basis, including toll-free numbers and electronic reporting through our website and mobile application. Our insurance subsidiaries strive to respond to notifications of claims promptly, generally within the day reported. Our insurance subsidiaries believe that, by responding promptly to claims, they provide quality customer service and minimize the ultimate cost of the claims. Our insurance subsidiaries engage independent adjusters as needed to handle claims in areas in which the volume of claims is not sufficient to justify the hiring of internal claims adjusters by our insurance subsidiaries. Our insurance subsidiaries also employ private adjusters and investigators, structural experts and various outside legal counsel to supplement their internal staff and to assist in the investigation of claims. Our insurance subsidiaries have a special investigative unit primarily staffed by former law enforcement officers that attempts to identify and prevent fraud and abuse and to investigate questionable claims. The management of the claims departments of our insurance subsidiaries develops and implements policies and procedures for the establishment of adequate claim reserves. Our insurance subsidiaries employ an actuarial staff that regularly reviews their reserves for incurred but not reported claims. The management and staff of the claims departments resolve policy coverage issues, manage and process reinsurance recoveries and handle salvage and subrogation matters. The litigation and personal injury sections of our insurance subsidiaries manage all claims litigation. Branch office claims above certain thresholds require home office review and settlement authorization. Our insurance subsidiaries provide their claims adjusters reserving and settlement authority based upon their experience and demonstrated abilities. Larger or more complicated claims require consultation and approval of senior claims department management. Liabilities for Losses and Loss Expenses Liabilities for losses and loss expenses are estimates at a given point in time of the amounts an insurer expects to pay with respect to incurred policyholder claims based on facts and circumstances the insurer knows at that point in time. At the time of &#160;establishing its estimates, an insurer recognizes that its ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses will exceed or be less than such estimates. Our insurance subsidiaries base their estimates of liabilities for losses and loss expenses on assumptions as to future loss trends, expected claims severity, judicial theories of liability and other factors. However, during the loss adjustment period, our insurance subsidiaries may learn additional facts regarding individual claims, and, consequently, it often becomes necessary for our insurance subsidiaries to refine and adjust their estimates for these liabilities. We reflect any adjustments to the liabilities for losses and loss expenses of our insurance subsidiaries in our consolidated results of operations in the period in which our insurance subsidiaries make adjustments to their estimates. Our insurance subsidiaries maintain liabilities for the payment of losses and loss expenses with respect to both reported and unreported claims. Our insurance subsidiaries establish these liabilities for the purpose of covering the ultimate costs of settling all losses, including investigation and litigation costs. Our insurance subsidiaries base the amount of their liability for reported losses primarily upon a case-by-case evaluation of the type of risk involved, knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each claim and the insurance policy provisions relating to the type of loss the policyholder incurred. Our insurance subsidiaries determine the amount of their liability for unreported claims and loss expenses on the basis of historical information by line of insurance. Our insurance subsidiaries account for inflation in the reserving function through analysis of costs and trends and reviews of historical reserving results. Our insurance subsidiaries monitor their liabilities closely and recompute them periodically using new information on reported claims and a variety of statistical techniques. Our insurance subsidiaries do not discount their liabilities for losses and loss expenses. Reserve estimates can change over time because of unexpected changes in assumptions related to our insurance subsidiaries&#146; external environment and, to a lesser extent, assumptions related to our insurance subsidiaries&#146; internal operations. For example, our insurance subsidiaries have experienced an increase in claims severity and a lengthening of the claim settlement periods on bodily injury claims during the past several years. These trend changes give rise to greater uncertainty as to the pattern of future loss settlements on bodily injury claims. Related uncertainties regarding future trends include the rate of plaintiff attorney involvement in claims and the cost of medical technologies and procedures. Assumptions related to our insurance subsidiaries&#146; external environment include the absence of significant changes in tort law and the legal environment that increase liability exposure, consistency in judicial interpretations of insurance coverage and policy provisions and the rate of loss cost inflation. Internal assumptions include consistency in the recording of premium and loss statistics, consistency in the recording of claims, payment and case reserving methodology, accurate measurement of the impact of rate changes and changes in policy provisions, consistency in the quality and characteristics of business written within a given line of business and consistency in reinsurance coverage and collectability of reinsured losses, among other items. To the extent our insurance subsidiaries determine that underlying factors impacting their assumptions have changed, our insurance subsidiaries make adjustments in their reserves that they consider appropriate for such changes. Accordingly, our insurance subsidiaries&#146; ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses will likely differ from the amount recorded at December 31, 2019. For every 1% change in our insurance subsidiaries&#146; loss and loss expense reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable, the effect on our pre-tax results of operations would be approximately $5.1 million. The establishment of appropriate liabilities is an inherently uncertain process and we can provide no assurance that our insurance subsidiaries&#146; ultimate liability will not exceed our insurance subsidiaries&#146; loss and loss expense reserves and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we cannot predict the timing, frequency and extent of adjustments to our insurance subsidiaries&#146; estimated future liabilities, because the historical conditions and events that serve as a basis for our insurance subsidiaries&#146; estimates of ultimate claim costs may change. As is the case for substantially all property and casualty insurance companies, our insurance subsidiaries have found it necessary in the past to increase their estimated future liabilities for losses and loss expenses in certain periods and, in other periods, their estimated future liabilities for losses and loss expenses have exceeded their actual liabilities for losses and loss expenses. Changes in our insurance subsidiaries&#146; estimates of their liability for losses and loss expenses generally reflect actual payments and their evaluation of information received subsequent to the prior reporting period. Our insurance subsidiaries recognized a (decrease) increase in their liability for losses and loss expenses of prior years of ($12.9 million), $35.6 million and $6.6 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our insurance subsidiaries made no significant changes in their reserving philosophy or claims management personnel, and they have made no significant offsetting changes in estimates that increased or decreased their loss and loss expense reserves in those years. The 2019 development represented 2.7% of the December 31, 2018 net carried reserves and resulted primarily from lower-than-expected severity in the workers&#146; compensation line of business, partially offset by higher-than-expected severity in the commercial automobile and commercial multi-peril lines of business, for accident years prior to 2019. The majority of the 2019 development related to decreases in the liability for losses and loss expenses of prior years for Atlantic States and Michigan. The 2018 development represented 9.3% of the December 31, 2017 net carried reserves and resulted primarily from higher-than-expected severity in the commercial multi-peril, personal automobile and commercial automobile lines of business, offset by lower-than-expected severity in the workers&#146; compensation line of business, for accident years prior to 2018. The majority of the 2018 development related to increases in the liability for losses and loss expenses of prior years for Atlantic States and Southern. During 2018, our insurance subsidiaries received new information on previously-reported &#160;commercial automobile and personal automobile claims that led our insurance subsidiaries to conclude that their prior actuarial assumptions did not fully anticipate recent changes in severity and reporting trends. Our insurance subsidiaries have encountered increasing difficulties in projecting the ultimate severity of automobile losses over recent accident years, which our insurance subsidiaries attribute to worsening litigation trends and an increased delay in the reporting to our insurance subsidiaries of information with respect to the severity of claims. As a result, our insurance subsidiaries&#146; actuaries increased their projections of the ultimate cost of our insurance subsidiaries&#146; prior-year personal automobile and commercial automobile losses, and our insurance subsidiaries added $17.7 million to their reserves for personal automobile and $20.8 million to their reserves for commercial automobile for accident years prior to 2018. The 2017 development represented 1.9% of the December 31, 2016 net carried reserves and resulted primarily from higher-than-expected severity in the commercial multi-peril, personal automobile and commercial automobile lines of business, offset by lower-than-expected severity in the workers&#146; compensation line of business, for accident years prior to 2017. The majority of the 2017 development related to increases in the liability for losses and loss expenses of prior years for Atlantic States and Peninsula. Excluding the impact of severe weather events, our insurance subsidiaries have noted stable amounts in the number of claims incurred and the number of claims outstanding at period ends relative to their premium base in recent years across most of their lines of business. However, the amount of the average claim outstanding has increased gradually over the past several years due to various factors such as rising medical loss costs and increased litigation trends. We have also experienced a general slowing of settlement rates in litigated claims. Our insurance subsidiaries could have to make further adjustments to their estimates in the future. However, on the basis of our insurance subsidiaries&#146; internal procedures, which analyze, among other things, their prior assumptions, their experience with similar cases and historical trends such as reserving patterns, loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims and product mix, as well as court decisions, economic conditions and public attitudes, we believe that our insurance subsidiaries have made adequate provision for their liability for losses and loss expenses. Atlantic States&#146; participation in the pool with Donegal Mutual exposes Atlantic States to adverse loss development on the business of Donegal Mutual that the pool includes. However, pooled business represents the predominant percentage of the net underwriting activity of both companies, and Donegal Mutual and Atlantic States share proportionately any adverse risk development relating to the pooled business. The business in the pool is homogeneous and each company has a pro-rata share of the entire pool. Since the predominant percentage of the business of Atlantic States and Donegal Mutual is pooled and the results shared by each company according to its participation level under the terms of the pooling agreement, the intent of the underwriting pool is to produce a more uniform and stable underwriting result from year to year for each company than either would experience individually and to spread the risk of loss between the companies. Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries operate together as the Donegal Insurance Group and share a combined business plan designed to achieve market penetration and underwriting profitability objectives. The products our insurance subsidiaries and Donegal Mutual offer are generally complementary, thereby allowing Donegal Insurance Group to offer a broader range of products to a given market and to expand Donegal Insurance Group&#146;s ability to service an entire personal lines or commercial lines account. Distinctions within the products of Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries generally relate to specific risk profiles targeted within similar classes of business, such as preferred tier products compared to standard tier products, but we do not allocate all of the standard risk gradients to one company. Therefore, the underwriting profitability of the business the individual companies write directly will vary. Differences between liabilities reported in our financial statements prepared on a GAAP basis and our insurance subsidiaries&#146; financial statements prepared on a SAP basis result from anticipating salvage and subrogation recoveries for GAAP but not for SAP. These differences amounted to $20.2 million, $20.0 million and $18.0 million at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. &#160;The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the beginning and ending GAAP net liability of our insurance subsidiaries for unpaid losses and loss expenses for the periods indicated: &#160;&#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; (in thousands) &#160; 2019 &#160; &#160; 2018 &#160; &#160; 2017 &#160; Gross liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses at beginning of year&#160; $ 814,665 &#160; &#160; $ 676,672 &#160; &#160; $ 606,665 &#160; Less reinsurance recoverable&#160; &#160; 339,267 &#160; &#160; &#160; 293,271 &#160; &#160; &#160; 259,147 &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; Net liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses at beginning of year&#160; &#160; 475,398 &#160; &#160; &#160; 383,401 &#160; &#160; &#160; 347,518 &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; Provision for net losses and loss expenses for claims incurred in the current year&#160; &#160; 519,320 &#160; &#160; &#160; 540,827 &#160; &#160; &#160; 480,647 &#160; Change in provision for estimated net losses and loss expenses for claims incurred in prior years&#160; &#160; (12,932 ) &#160; &#160; 35,631 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,621 &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; Total incurred&#160; &#160; 506,388 &#160; &#160; &#160; 576,458 &#160; &#160; &#160; 487,268 &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; Net losses and loss expense payments for claims incurred during:&#160; &#160; &#160; The current year&#160; &#160; 278,924 &#160; &#160; &#160; 308,578 &#160; &#160; &#160; 288,380 &#160; Prior years&#160; &#160; 195,956 &#160; &#160; &#160; 175,883 &#160; &#160; &#160; 163,005 &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; Total paid&#160; &#160; 474,880 &#160; &#160; &#160; 484,461 &#160; &#160; &#160; 451,385 &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; Net liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses at end of year&#160; &#160; 506,906 &#160; &#160; &#160; 475,398 &#160; &#160; &#160; 383,401 &#160; Plus reinsurance recoverable&#160; &#160; 362,768 &#160; &#160; &#160; 339,267 &#160; &#160; &#160; 293,271 &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; Gross liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses at end of year&#160; $ 869,674 &#160; &#160; $ 814,665 &#160; &#160; $ 676,672 &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; The following table sets forth the development of the liability for net unpaid losses and loss expenses of our insurance subsidiaries from 2009 to 2019. Loss data in the table includes business Atlantic States received from the underwriting pool. &#147;Net liability at end of year for unpaid losses and loss expenses&#148; sets forth the estimated liability for net unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. This liability represents the estimated amount of net losses and loss expenses for claims arising in the current and all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date, including losses incurred but not reported. The &#147;Net liability re-estimated as of&#148; portion of the table shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience for each succeeding year. The estimate increases or decreases as payments are made and more information becomes known about the severity of the remaining unpaid claims. For example, the 2009 liability has developed a deficiency after ten years because we expect the re-estimated net losses and loss expenses to be $419,000 more than the estimated liability we initially established in 2009 of $180.3 million. The &#147;Cumulative deficiency (excess)&#148; shows the cumulative deficiency or excess at December 31, 2019 of the liability estimate shown on the top line of the corresponding column. A deficiency in liability means that the liability established in prior years was less than the amount of actual payments and currently re-estimated remaining unpaid liability. An excess in liability means that the liability established in prior years exceeded the amount of actual payments and currently re-estimated unpaid liability remaining. The &#147;Cumulative amount of liability paid through&#148; portion of the table shows the cumulative net losses and loss expense payments made in succeeding years for net losses incurred prior to the balance sheet date. For example, the 2009 column indicates that at December 31, 2019 payments equal to $177.4 million of the currently re-estimated ultimate liability for net losses and loss expenses of $180.7 million had been made. Amounts shown in the 2010 column of the table include information for MICO for all accident years prior to 2010. &#160;&#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; (in thousands) &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160;

Best. The external reinsurance our insurance subsidiaries and Donegal Mutual purchased for 2019 included: &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; excess of loss reinsurance, under which the losses of Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries were automatically reinsured, through a series of contracts, over a set retention; and &#160;&#160; &#149; &#160; catastrophe reinsurance, under which Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries recovered, through a series of reinsurance agreements, 100% of an accumulation of many losses resulting from a single event, including natural disasters, over a set retention of $10.0 million and after exceeding an annual aggregate deductible of $1.2 million up to aggregate losses of $190.0 million per occurrence. For property insurance, our insurance subsidiaries had excess of loss treaties that provided for coverage of $34.0 million per loss over a set retention of $1.0 million.

Actual maturities will differ because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. As shown above, our insurance subsidiaries held investments in mortgage-backed securities having a carrying value of $361.7 million at December 31, 2019. The mortgage-backed securities consist primarily of investments in governmental agency balloon pools with stated maturities between one and 38 years. The stated maturities of these investments limit the exposure of our insurance subsidiaries to extension risk in the event that interest rates rise and prepayments decline. Our insurance subsidiaries perform an analysis of the underlying loans when evaluating a mortgage-backed security for purchase, and they select those securities that they believe will provide a return that properly reflects the prepayment risk associated with the underlying loans. The following table sets forth the investment results of our insurance subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017: &#160;&#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; (dollars in thousands) &#160; 2019 &#160; &#160; 2018 &#160; &#160; 2017 &#160; Invested assets (1) &#160; $ 1,070,676 &#160; &#160; $ 1,018,334 &#160; &#160; $ 975,695 &#160; Investment income (2) &#160; &#160; 29,515 &#160; &#160; &#160; 26,908 &#160; &#160; &#160; 23,527 &#160; Average yield&#160; &#160; 2.8 % &#160; &#160; 2.6 % &#160; &#160; 2.4 % Average tax-equivalent yield&#160; &#160; 2.9 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.8 &#160; &#160;(1) Average of the aggregate invested amounts at the beginning and end of the period. (2) Investment income is net of investment expenses and does not include investment gains or losses or provision for income taxes. A.M. Best Rating Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries have an A.M. Best rating of A (Excellent), based upon the respective current financial condition and historical statutory results of operations of Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries. We believe that the A.M. Best rating of Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries is an important factor in their marketing of their products to their agents and customers. A.M. Best&#146;s ratings are industry ratings based on a comparative analysis of the financial condition and operating performance of insurance companies. A.M. Best&#146;s classifications are A++ and A+ (Superior), A and A- (Excellent), B++ and B+ (Good), B and B- (Fair), C++ and C+ (Marginal), C and C- (Weak), D (Poor), E (Under Regulatory Supervision), F (Liquidation) and S (Suspended). A.M. Best bases its ratings upon factors relevant to the payment of claims of policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors in insurance companies. According to A.M. Best, the &#147;Excellent&#148; rating that the Donegal Insurance Group maintains is assigned to those companies that, in A.M. Best&#146;s opinion, have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations. &#160;Regulation The supervision and regulation of insurance companies consists primarily of the laws and regulations of the various states in which the insurance companies transact business, with the primary regulatory authority being the insurance regulatory authorities in the state of domicile of the insurance company. Such supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of an insurance company&#146;s business and financial condition. The primary purpose of such supervision and regulation is the protection of policyholders. The authority of the state insurance departments includes the establishment of standards of solvency that insurers must meet and maintain, the licensing of insurers and insurance agents to do business, the nature of, and limitations on, investments, premium rates for property and casualty insurance, the provisions that insurers must make for current losses and future liabilities, the deposit of securities for the benefit of policyholders, the approval of policy forms, notice requirements for the cancellation of policies and the approval of certain changes in control. State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies. In addition to state-imposed insurance laws and regulations, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or the NAIC, maintains a risk-based capital system, or RBC, for assessing the adequacy of the statutory capital and surplus of insurance companies that augments the states&#146; current fixed dollar minimum capital requirements for insurance companies. At December 31, 2019, our insurance subsidiaries and Donegal Mutual each exceeded by a substantial margin the minimum levels of statutory capital the RBC rules require. Generally, every state has guaranty fund laws under which insurers licensed to do business in that state can be assessed on the basis of premiums written by the insurer in that state in order to fund policyholder liabilities of insolvent insurance companies. Under these laws in general, an insurer is subject to assessment, depending upon its market share of a given line of business, to assist in the payment of policyholder claims against insolvent insurers. Our insurance subsidiaries and Donegal Mutual have made accruals for their portion of assessments related to such insolvencies based upon the most current information furnished by the guaranty associations. We are part of an insurance holding company system of which Donegal Mutual is the ultimate controlling person. All of the states in which our insurance companies and Donegal Mutual maintain a domicile have legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems. Each insurance company in the insurance holding company system must register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the insurance holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. Pursuant to these laws, the respective insurance departments in which our subsidiaries and Donegal Mutual maintain a domicile may examine our insurance subsidiaries or Donegal Mutual at any time, require disclosure of material transactions by the holding company with another member of the insurance holding company system and require prior notice or prior approval of certain transactions, such as &#147;extraordinary dividends&#148; from the insurance subsidiaries to the holding company. We have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in Maryland, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The Pennsylvania Insurance Holding Companies Act, which generally applies to Donegal Mutual, us and our insurance subsidiaries, requires that all transactions within an insurance holding company system to which an insurer is a party must be fair and reasonable and that any charges or fees for services performed must be reasonable. Any management agreement, service agreement, cost sharing arrangement and material reinsurance agreement must be filed with the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, or the Department, and is subject to the Department&#146;s review. We have filed with the Department the pooling agreement between Donegal Mutual and Atlantic States that established the underwriting pool and all material agreements between Donegal Mutual and our insurance subsidiaries. Approval of the applicable insurance commissioner is also required prior to consummation of transactions affecting the control of an insurer. In virtually all states, including the states where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, the acquisition of 10% or more of the outstanding capital stock of an insurer or its holding company or the intent to acquire such an interest creates a rebuttable presumption of a change in control. Pursuant to an order issued in April 2003, the Department approved Donegal Mutual&#146;s ownership of up to 70% of our outstanding Class A common stock and Donegal Mutual&#146;s ownership of up to 100% of our outstanding Class B common stock. Our insurance subsidiaries have the legal obligation under state insurance laws to participate in involuntary insurance programs for automobile insurance, as well as other property and casualty insurance lines, in the states in which they conduct business. These programs include joint underwriting associations, assigned risk plans, fair access to insurance requirements plans, reinsurance facilities, windstorm plans and tornado plans. Legislation establishing these programs requires all companies that write lines covered by these programs to provide coverage, either directly or through reinsurance, for insureds who are unable to obtain insurance in the voluntary market. The legislation creating these programs usually allocates a pro rata portion &#160;of risks attributable to such insureds to each company on the basis of the direct premiums it has written in that state or the number of automobiles it insures in that state. Generally, state law requires participation in these programs as a condition to obtaining a certificate of authority. Our loss ratio on insurance we write under these involuntary programs has traditionally been significantly greater than our loss ratio on insurance we voluntarily write in those states. Regulatory requirements, including RBC requirements, may impact our insurance subsidiaries&#146; ability to pay dividends. The amount of statutory capital and surplus necessary for our insurance subsidiaries to satisfy regulatory requirements, including RBC requirements, was not significant in relation to our insurance subsidiaries&#146; statutory capital and surplus at December 31, 2019. Generally, the maximum amount that one of our insurance subsidiaries may pay to us as ordinary dividends during any year after notice to, but without prior approval of, the insurance commissioner of its domiciliary state is limited to a stated percentage of that subsidiary&#146;s statutory capital and surplus at December 31 of the preceding fiscal year or the net income of that subsidiary for its preceding fiscal year. Our insurance subsidiaries paid dividends to us of $4.0 million, $11.0 million and $13.0 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2019, the amount of ordinary dividends our insurance subsidiaries could pay to us during 2020, without the prior approval of their respective domiciliary insurance commissioners, is shown in the following table. &#160;Name of Insurance Subsidiary &#160; Ordinary Dividend Amount &#160; Atlantic States&#160; $ 25,903,087 &#160; MICO&#160; &#160; 6,576,859 &#160; Peninsula&#160; &#160; 1,983,678 &#160; Southern&#160; &#160; 5,440,557 &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; Total&#160; $ 39,904,181 &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; Donegal Mutual Insurance Company Donegal Mutual organized as a mutual fire insurance company in Pennsylvania in 1889.

Graham Holdings Company (the Company) is a diversified education and media company whose operations include educational services; television broadcasting; online, print and local TV news; home health and hospice care; and manufacturing. The Company&#8217;s Kaplan, Inc. (Kaplan) subsidiary provides a wide variety of educational services, both domestically and outside the United States (U.S.). The Company&#8217;s media operations comprise the ownership and operation of television broadcasting (through the ownership and operation of seven television broadcast stations) plus Slate and Foreign Policy magazines; Megaphone, a provider of podcast technology for publishers and advertisers; and Pinna, an ad-free audio streaming service for children. The Company also owns home health and hospice providers, four industrial companies, automotive dealerships, restaurants, and Social Code LLC, a marketing solutions provider. Financial information concerning the principal segments of the Company&#8217;s business for the past three fiscal years is contained in Note 19 to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenues for each segment are shown in Note 19 gross of intersegment sales. Consolidated revenues are reported net of intersegment sales, which did not exceed 0.1% of consolidated operating revenues. The Company&#8217;s operations in geographic areas outside the U.S. consist primarily of Kaplan&#8217;s non-U.S. operations. During each of the fiscal years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , these operations accounted for approximately 24% , 24% and 25% , respectively, of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenues, and the identifiable assets attributable to non-U.S. operations represented approximately 24% and 23% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Education Kaplan, a subsidiary of the Company, provides an extensive range of education and related services worldwide for students and professionals. In 2019, Kaplan, through its four segments discussed below, served more than 1,100,000 students and professionals worldwide and had associations with more than 4,000 companies and commercial relationships with more than 2,000 universities, colleges, schools and school districts across the globe. Kaplan conducts its operations through four segments: Kaplan International, Kaplan Higher Education, Kaplan Test Preparation and Kaplan Professional (U.S.). In addition, the results of the Kaplan Corporate segment include results of Kaplan&#8217;s investment activities in education technology companies. The following table presents revenues for each of Kaplan&#8217;s segments: &#160; Year Ended December 31 (in thousands) &#160; &#160; Kaplan International $ 750,245 &#160; $ 719,982 &#160; $ 697,999 Kaplan Higher Education 305,672 &#160; 342,085 &#160; 431,425 Kaplan Test Preparation 243,917 &#160; 256,102 &#160; 273,298 Kaplan Professional (U.S.) 144,897 &#160; 134,187 &#160; 115,839 Kaplan Corporate and Intersegment Eliminations 7,019 &#160; (1,341 ) &#160; (1,785 ) Total Kaplan Revenue $ 1,451,750 &#160; $ 1,451,015 &#160; $ 1,516,776 Kaplan International Kaplan International (KI) operates businesses in Europe and the Middle East, North America and the Asia Pacific region, each of which is discussed below. On July 11, 2019, Kaplan acquired Heverald, the owner of ESL Education, Europe&#8217;s largest language-travel agency, and Alpadia, a chain of German and French language schools and junior summer camps. Europe and Middle East. &#160; In Europe, KI operates the following businesses, all of which are based in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland: Kaplan UK, KI Pathways, KI Languages, Mander Portman Woodward, Dublin Business School and Kaplan Open Learning. In the Middle East, Kaplan International has operations in the United Arab Emirates. The Kaplan UK business in Europe, through Kaplan Financial Limited, is a provider of training, test preparation services and degrees for accounting and financial services professionals, including those studying for ACCA, CIMA and ICAEW qualifications. In addition, Kaplan UK provides professional training. In 2019 , Kaplan UK provided courses to over 50,000 students in accountancy and financial services. Kaplan UK is headquartered in London, England, and has 21 training centers located throughout the U.K. The KI Pathways business offers academic preparation programs especially designed for international students who wish to study for degrees from universities in English-speaking countries. In 2019, university preparation programs were delivered in Australia, Japan, Myanmar, Singapore, the U.K. and the U.S., serving approximately 14,000 students in association with more than 40 universities. The KI Languages business provides English-language training, academic preparation programs and test preparation for English proficiency exams, principally for students wishing to study and travel in English-speaking countries. KI Languages operates 35 English-language schools, with 19 located in the U.K., Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Canada and 16 located in the U.S. In 2019 , KI Languages served approximately 35,000 students for in-class English-language instruction. Through its acquisition of the Alpadia language schools, KI Languages now also offers French and German language training in France, Germany and the U.K. Alpadia has four language schools, located in France, Germany and Switzerland, and operates summer language schools in other European destinations. KI Languages also offers Spanish language training in four Spanish cities through its partnership with Enforex. Mander Portman Woodward (MPW) is a U.K. independent sixth-form college that prepares domestic and international students for A-level examinations that are required for admission to U.K. universities. MPW operates three colleges, in London, Cambridge and Birmingham. KI also operates Dublin Business School in Ireland, a higher education institution, and Kaplan Open Learning in the U.K., an online learning institution. At the end of 2019 , these institutions enrolled an aggregate of approximately 6,000 students. In 2019, Kaplan Genesis, a financial training business operating in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, taught approximately 3,000 students. U.K. Immigration Regulations. Certain KI businesses serve a significant number of international students; therefore, the ability to sponsor students from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland to come to the U.K. is critical to these businesses. Pursuant to regulations administered by the United Kingdom Visas and Immigration Department (UKVI), the KI Pathways business is required to hold or operate Tier 4 sponsorship licenses for international students to be permitted to enter the U.K. to study the courses KI Pathways delivers. One of the KI Languages schools also has a Tier 4 license to enable it to teach international students, although students studying the English language may generally choose to enter the U.K. on a short-term study visa as opposed to a Tier 4 visa. Each Tier 4 license holder is required to have passed the Basic Compliance Assessment (BCA) and hold Educational Oversight accreditation. Without these criteria being met, KI&#8217;s U.K. schools would not be permitted to issue a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies to potential incoming international students, which is a prerequisite for obtaining a Tier 4 student visa. The UKVI rules also require all private institutions to obtain Educational Oversight accreditation, which requires a current and satisfactory full inspection, audit or review by the appropriate academic standards body. For the eighth consecutive year, 100% of KI institutions have retained Tier 4 Educational Oversight accreditation, with high grades across all colleges, and all Tier 4 license renewals have been approved again with high scores in the core measurable requirements. KI Languages has one U.K. English-language school listed on the Kaplan Tier 4 master license. The MPW schools each holds current Tier 4 licenses and have performed well consistently, with good records in their Office for Standards in Education, Children&#8217;s Services and Skills (OFSTED) and Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) Educational Oversight inspections. The Higher Education and Research Act 2017 (HERA) received formal approval on April 27, 2017. HERA undertook a significant reform of regulation of the higher education sector in the U.K., including the formation of a new regulator, the Office for Students (OfS). The 2018&#8211;2019 academic year was a transition year under the new regulatory framework. The OfS published regulatory guidance in April 2019, including the new Regulatory Framework for Higher Education in England. Pathways institutions registered with the OfS will be, for the first time, recognized as Higher Education Providers, with students of approved providers having many of the same Tier 4 privileges as students of universities in the U.K. All of KI&#8217;s other higher education businesses in the U.K. will need to successfully complete registration with the OfS in 2020 to ensure that they continue operating and retain their Tier 4 sponsor licenses and\/or continue to accept students funded by U.K. student loans. No assurance can be given that each KI business required to register with the OfS will be successful in doing so. Failure to register with the OfS would result in the loss of a Tier 4 license and, where relevant, the inability to accept students funded by U.K. domestic student loans. Kaplan Open Learning has successfully completed its OfS registration. Additionally, no assurance can be given that each KI business in the U.K. will be able to maintain its Tier 4 BCA status and Educational Oversight\/OfS registration. Maintenance of each of these approvals requires compliance with several core metrics that may be difficult to attain. Failure of one or more institutions to successfully register with the OfS, or loss by one or more institutions of either Tier 4 BCA status or Educational Oversight\/OfS registration, would have a material adverse effect on KI Europe&#8217;s operating results. Impact of Brexit. On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved a proposal that the U.K. leave the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as &#8220;Brexit.&#8221; The U.K.&#8217;s withdrawal became effective on January 31, 2020, at which time it entered an 11-month transition period. The impact of Brexit on KI will depend, in part, on the outcome of future negotiations regarding the terms of the U.K.&#8217;s withdrawal from the EU, possibly including the outcome of any &#8220;no deal&#8221; exit. A &#8220;no deal&#8221; exit would occur if the U.K. government is not able to reach agreement with the EU on their future relationship upon exit at the end of 2020, unless an extension of time to the transition period is agreed upon. A U.K. exit on a &#8220;no deal&#8221; basis could adversely affect the value of the British pound as compared with other currencies or potentially have other adverse consequences and may materially adversely affect KI&#8217;s results of operations. Uncertainty over the outcome of the negotiations and the possibility of a &#8220;no deal&#8221; exit may materially or significantly diminish interest in traveling to the U.K. for study. If the U.K. is no longer viewed as a favorable study destination, KI&#8217;s ability to recruit international students will be adversely impacted, which would materially adversely affect KI&#8217;s results of operations and cash flows. Changes continue to be made to U.K. immigration rules, with revised rules (which may include significant changes) expected to be put in place for January 2021, as the Brexit transition is completed. While proposals for changes to criteria for student study visas were put forward in an Immigration White Paper in 2018, no assurances can be given that the new U.K. government will implement those proposed rules. It is unclear how international student recruitment agents and prospective international students may view the U.K. as a study destination after the introduction of any new immigration requirements, the EU exit negotiations and the U.K.&#8217;s exit from the EU. The introduction of revised immigration rules has historically increased, and may continue to increase, KI&#8217;s operating costs in the U.K. The introduction of new visa and other administrative requirements for entry into the U.K., Brexit and the perception of the U.K. as a less favorable study destination may have a materially adverse impact on KI&#8217;s ability to recruit international students and KI&#8217;s results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, if the U.K. does not receive a determination of adequacy under the EU General Data Protection Regulation, then flows of personal data within KI or between KI and its clients, suppliers, business partners and affiliates may be substantially disrupted. Asia Pacific. &#160; In the Asia Pacific region, Kaplan operates businesses primarily in Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and the People&#8217;s Republic of China, including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong). In Singapore, Kaplan operates three business units: Kaplan Higher Education, Kaplan Financial and Kaplan Professional. During 2019, the Higher Education and Financial divisions served more than 10,000 students from Singapore and 5,400 students from other countries throughout Asia and Western Europe. Kaplan Professional provided short courses to approximately 14,800 professionals, managers, executives and businesspeople in 2019. Kaplan Singapore&#8217;s Higher Education business provides students with the opportunity to earn bachelor&#8217;s and postgraduate degrees in various fields on either a part-time or full-time basis. Kaplan Singapore&#8217;s students receive degrees from affiliated educational institutions in Australia, Ireland and the U.K. In addition, this division offers pre-university and diploma programs. Kaplan Singapore&#8217;s Financial business provides preparatory courses for professional qualifications in accountancy and finance, such as the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA). Kaplan Singapore&#8217;s Professional business, which was an authorized SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) Approved Training Organization (ATO), provided professionals with various skills training through workforce skills qualifications courses. On June 11, 2019, Kaplan Professional was notified by SSG, which is a statutory board under the Singapore Ministry of Education, that SSG had suspended Kaplan Singapore Professional&#8217;s Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) ATO status. The notice further revoked accreditation and funding for all WSQ courses with effect from July 1, 2019. Kaplan Learning Institute, the entity that had previously operated the WSQ courses, confirmed its intention to cease offering WSQ courses and subsequently began voluntarily de-registering as a private education institution. These actions have and will continue to adversely affect Kaplan Singapore&#8217;s revenues and operating results. In Australia, Kaplan delivers a broad range of financial services programs from certificate level through master&#8217;s level, together with professional development offerings through Kaplan Professional, as well as higher education programs in business, accounting, hospitality, and tourism and management through Kaplan Business School. In 2019 , these businesses provided courses to approximately 5,000 students through face-to-face classroom programs (within Kaplan Business School) and approximately 23,800 students through online or distance-learning programs offered by Kaplan Professional. In 2019, Kaplan Professional also had approximately 37,400 subscribers for Ontrack, its continuing professional development platform for financial services professionals. In 2018, the Australian government introduced legislation that requires higher-level education standards, a compulsory national exam and other increased requirements in relation to continuing professional development for all financial advisors in Australia. These new requirements may cause advisors to leave the industry, which may result in a loss of those existing students for Kaplan Professional Australia. Kaplan Australia&#8217;s English-language business is part of KI Languages, which operates across five locations in Australia and one location in New Zealand, teaching more than 5,000 students in 2019. The Kaplan Australia Pathways business is also part of KI Pathways. It consists of Murdoch Institute of Technology and the University of Adelaide College and offered face-to-face pathways and foundational education to more than 2,600 students wishing to enter Murdoch University in Perth and the University of Adelaide in 2019. The original contract with Murdoch University to run the Murdoch Institute of Technology was set to expire in 2020 and on March 20, 2019, Kaplan Australia agreed to a 12-month extension, until June 2021. In November 2019, Kaplan Australia obtained regulatory approval to operate a Melbourne campus for the University of Adelaide, which will commence in July 2020. Kaplan Australia also owns Red Marker Pty Ltd., a machine learning and artificial intelligence-based provider of regulatory software. Its Artemis product detects potentially non-compliant content as it is being created, helping advisers and licensees to identify and remediate compliance risks associated with the promotion of financial products or services. In Hong Kong, Kaplan operates three main business units: Kaplan Financial, Kaplan Language Training and Kaplan Higher Education, serving approximately 13,000 students annually. Kaplan Hong Kong&#8217;s Financial division delivers preparatory courses to approximately 11,000 students and business executives wishing to earn professional qualifications in accountancy, financial markets designations and other professional fields. Hong Kong&#8217;s Language Training division offers test preparation for both overseas study and college applications, including TOEFL, IELTS, SAT and GMAT, to approximately 1,000 students. Kaplan Hong Kong&#8217;s Higher Education division offers both full-time and part-time programs to approximately 1,000 students studying for degrees from leading Western universities. Students earn doctorate, master&#8217;s and bachelor&#8217;s degrees in Hong Kong. Kaplan also offers a proprietary pre-college diploma program through the Kaplan Business and Accountancy School. In 2014, Kaplan Holdings Limited (Hong Kong) signed a joint venture agreement with CITIC Press Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, the parties incorporated a joint venture company, Kaplan CITIC Education Co. Limited, which is 49% owned by Kaplan Holdings Limited. The joint venture company is carrying out publishing and distribution of Kaplan Financial training products in the People&#8217;s Republic of China (including CFA, FRM and ACCA) and is expanding its business with other Kaplan divisions under an intellectual property license from Kaplan. Each of Kaplan&#8217;s international businesses is subject to unique and often complex regulatory environments in the countries in which they operate, and the degree of consistency in the application and interpretation of such regulations can vary significantly in certain jurisdictions. Kaplan Higher Education Until March 22, 2018, Kaplan Higher Education (KHE) provided postsecondary education services to students through Kaplan University&#8217;s (KU) online and fixed-facility colleges. KU provided a wide array of certificate, diploma and degree programs designed to meet the needs of students seeking to advance their education and career goals. On March 22, 2018, certain subsidiaries of Kaplan contributed the institutional assets and operations of KU to a new university: an Indiana nonprofit, public-benefit corporation affiliated with Purdue University, known as Purdue University Global (Purdue Global). As part of the transfer to Purdue Global, KU transferred students, academic personnel, faculty and operations, property leases for KU&#8217;s campuses and learning centers, and KHE-owned academic curricula and content related to KU courses. Kaplan also indemnified Purdue for certain pre-closing liabilities. At the same time, KU and Purdue Global entered into a Transition and Operations Support Agreement, which was amended on July 29, 2019 (TOSA), pursuant to which KHE provides key non-academic operations support to Purdue Global. Kaplan received nominal cash consideration upon the transfer of the institutional assets and operations of KU. The transfer of KU did not include any of the assets of the KU School of Professional and Continuing Education, which provides professional training and exam preparation for professional certifications and licensures. It remains with Kaplan and is managed by Kaplan Professional. The transfer also did not include the transfer of other Kaplan businesses. KHE&#8217;s Third-Party Service Operations KHE&#8217;s primary business operations are providing non-academic operations support services to Purdue Global pursuant to the TOSA and similar services to Purdue University and other institutions of higher education. Purdue Global operates largely online as an Indiana public university affiliated with Purdue University. The operations support activities that KHE provides to Purdue Global (and other institutions of higher education, including Purdue University) include technology support, help-desk functions, human resources support for transferred faculty and employees, admissions support, financial aid processing, marketing and advertising, back-office business functions, certain test preparation, and domestic and international student recruiting services. Pursuant to the TOSA, KHE is not entitled to receive any reimbursement of costs incurred in providing support functions, or any fee, unless and until Purdue Global has first covered all of its operating costs (subject to a cap). If Purdue Global achieves cost efficiencies in its operations, it may be entitled to an additional payment equal to 20% of such cost efficiencies (Purdue Efficiency Payment). In addition, during each of Purdue Global&#8217;s first five years, prior to any payment to KHE, Purdue Global is entitled to a priority payment of $10 million per year beyond costs. (Purdue Priority Payment). To the extent that Purdue Global&#8217;s revenue is insufficient to pay the Purdue Priority Payment, KHE is required to advance an amount to Purdue Global to cover such insufficiency. Upon closing of the transaction, Kaplan paid to Purdue Global an advance in the amount of $20 million, representing, and in lieu of, a Purdue Priority Payment for each of the fiscal years ending June 30, 2019, and June 30, 2020. To the extent that there is sufficient revenue to pay the Purdue Efficiency Payment, Purdue Global will be reimbursed for its operating costs (subject to a cap) and will be paid the Purdue Priority Payment. To the extent that there is remaining revenue, KHE will then be reimbursed for its operating costs (subject to a cap) of providing the support activities. If KHE achieves cost efficiencies in its operations, then KHE may be entitled to an additional payment equal to 20% of such cost efficiencies (KHE Efficiency Payment). The TOSA, as amended, reflects the parties&#8217; intent that, subject to available cash (calculated as cash balance minus cash deficiencies, if any, projected for the next six-month period based on applicable budget), KHE is entitled to receive a fee equal to 12.5% (increasing to 13% from June 30, 2023, through June 30, 2027) of Purdue Global&#8217;s revenue, which served as the deferred purchase price for the transfer of KU (Deferred Purchase Price). Separately, KHE is entitled to a fee for services provided equal to 8% of KHE&#8217;s costs of providing such services to Purdue Global (Contributor Service Fee). KHE&#8217;s Contributor Service Fee is deducted from any amounts owed to KHE for the Deferred Purchase Price. Together these payments are known as &#8220;Contributor Compensation.&#8221; In each case the Contributor Compensation remains subject to available cash and the limitations of payment carry over from year to year. After the first five years of the TOSA, KHE and Purdue Global will be entitled to payments in a manner consistent with the structure described above, except that (i) Purdue Global will no longer be entitled to the Purdue Priority Payment and (ii) to the extent that there are sufficient revenues after payment of the KHE Efficiency Payment (if any), Purdue Global will be entitled to an annual payment equal to 10% of the remaining revenue after the KHE Efficiency Payment (if any) is paid, subject to certain other adjustments. The TOSA has a 30-year initial term, which will automatically renew for five-year periods unless terminated. After the sixth year, Purdue Global has the right to terminate the agreement upon payment of a termination fee equal to 125% of Purdue Global&#8217;s total revenue earned during the preceding 12-month period, which payment would be made pursuant to a 10-year note, and at the election of Purdue Global, it may receive for no additional consideration certain assets used by KHE to provide the support activities pursuant to the TOSA. At the end of the 30-year term, if Purdue Global does not renew the TOSA, Purdue Global will be obligated to make a final payment of 75% of its total revenue earned during the preceding 12-month period, which payment will be made pursuant to a 10-year note, and at the election of Purdue Global, it may receive for no additional consideration certain assets used by KHE to provide the support activities pursuant to the TOSA. Either party may terminate the TOSA at any time if Purdue Global generates (i) $25 million in cash operating losses for three consecutive years or (ii) aggregate cash operating losses greater than $75 million at any point during the initial term. Operating loss is defined as the amount by which the sum of (1) Purdue Global&#8217;s and KHE&#8217;s respective costs in performing academic and support functions and (2) the $10 million Purdue Priority Payment in each of the first five years following March 22, 2018, exceeds the revenue Purdue Global generates for the applicable fiscal year. Upon termination for any reason, Purdue Global will retain the assets that Kaplan contributed pursuant to the TOSA. Each party also has certain termination rights in connection with a material default or material breach of the TOSA by the other party. Regulatory Environment KHE no longer owns or operates KU or any other institution participating in student financial aid programs created under Title IV of the U.S. Federal Higher Education Act of 1965 (Higher Education Act), as amended (Title IV). KHE provides service to Purdue Global, Purdue University, and other Title IV participating institutions that may require KHE to comply with certain laws and regulations, including applicable statutory provisions of Title IV. KHE also provides financial aid services to Purdue Global and, as such, meets the definition of a &#8220;third-party servicer&#8221; contained in the Title IV regulations. As a third-party servicer, KHE is subject to applicable statutory provisions of Title IV and U.S. Department of Education (ED) regulations that, among other things, require KHE to be jointly and severally liable with its Title IV participating client institution(s) to the ED for any violation by such client institution of any Title IV statute or ED regulation or requirement. KHE is also subject to other federal and state laws, including, but not limited to, information security requirements established by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as the applicable provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act regarding the privacy of student records. KHE&#8217;s failure to comply with these and other federal and state laws and regulations could result in adverse consequences to KHE&#8217;s business, including, for example: &#8226; The imposition on KHE of fines or repayment obligations for Title IV funds to the ED or the termination or limitation on KHE&#8217;s eligibility to provide services as a third-party servicer to any Title IV participating institution; &#8226; Adverse effects on KHE&#8217;s business and results of operations from a reduction or loss in KHE&#8217;s revenues under the TOSA or any other agreement with any Title IV participating institution if a client institution loses or has limits placed on its Title IV eligibility, accreditation, operations or state licensure, or is subject to fines, repayment obligations or other adverse actions due to noncompliance by KHE (or the institution) with Title IV, accreditor, federal or state agency requirements; &#8226; Liability under the TOSA or any other agreement with any Title IV participating institution for noncompliance with federal, state or accreditation requirements arising from KHE&#8217;s conduct; and &#8226; Liability for noncompliance with Title IV or other federal or state laws and regulations occurring prior to the transfer of KU to Purdue. Incentive compensation . Under the ED&#8217;s incentive compensation rule, an institution participating in Title IV programs may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the awarding of Title IV funds if such payment is based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid. KHE is a third party providing bundled services to Title IV participating institutions that include recruiting and, in the case of Purdue Global, financial aid services. As such, KHE is also subject to the incentive compensation rules and cannot provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any covered employees, subcontractors or other parties engaged in certain student recruiting, admission or financial aid activities based on success in securing enrollments or financial aid. In addition, tuition revenue sharing payments to KHE under the TOSA (as well as any other agreement with any Title IV participating institution) must comply with revenue sharing guidance provided by the ED related to bundled services agreements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. Failure to Comply with the ED&#8217;s Title IV Incentive Compensation Rule Could Subject Kaplan to Liabilities, Sanctions and Fines for more information. Misrepresentations. A Title IV participating institution is required to comply with the ED regulations related to misrepresentations and with related federal and state laws. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and may extend to statements by servicers, such as KHE, that provide marketing or certain other services to such institutions. The laws and regulations may also apply to KHE&#8217;s employees and agents, with respect to statements addressing the nature of an institution&#8217;s programs, financial charges or the employability of its graduates. Additionally, failure to comply with these and other federal and state laws and regulations could result in the imposition on KHE or its client institutions of fines, penalties, federal student aid repayment obligations to the ED, the termination or limitation on KHE&#8217;s eligibility to provide services as a third-party servicer to Title IV participating institutions or the termination or limitation of a client institution&#8217;s eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs. A violation of misrepresentation regulations or other federal or state laws and regulations applicable to the services KHE provides to its client institutions arising out of statements by KHE, its employees or agents could require KHE to pay the costs associated with indemnifying its client institutions from applicable losses resulting from the violation. Compliance by client institutions with Title IV program requirements and other federal, state and accreditation requirements. KHE currently provides services to education institutions that are heavily regulated by federal and state laws and regulations and subject to extensive accrediting body requirements. Presently, a substantial portion of KHE&#8217;s revenues are attributable to service fees it receives under the TOSA, which are dependent upon revenues generated by Purdue Global and dependent upon Purdue Global&#8217;s eligibility to participate in the Title IV federal student aid program. To maintain Title IV eligibility, Purdue Global and KHE&#8217;s other client institutions must be certified by the ED as eligible institutions, maintain authorizations by applicable state education agencies and be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the ED. Purdue Global and KHE&#8217;s other client institutions must also comply with the extensive statutory and regulatory requirements of the Higher Education Act and other state and federal laws and accrediting standards relating to their financial aid management, educational programs, financial strength, disbursement and return of Title IV funds, facilities, recruiting practices, representations made by the school and various other matters. Additionally, Purdue Global and other client institutions are subject to laws and regulations that, among other things, limit student default rates on the repayment of Title IV loans, permit borrower defenses to repayment of Title IV loans based on certain conduct of the institution, establish specific measures of financial responsibility and administrative capability, and require state authorization and institutional and programmatic accreditation. If the ED finds that Purdue Global or other client institutions have failed to comply with Title IV requirements or improperly disbursed or retained Title IV program funds, it may take one or more of a number of actions, including, but not limited to: &#8226; fining the school; &#8226; requiring the school to repay Title IV program funds; &#8226; limiting or terminating the school&#8217;s eligibility to participate in Title IV programs; &#8226; initiating an emergency action to suspend the school&#8217;s participation in Title IV programs without prior notice or opportunity for a hearing; &#8226; transferring the school to a method of Title IV payment that would adversely affect the timing of the institution&#8217;s receipt of Title IV funds; &#8226; requiring the submission of a letter of credit; &#8226; denying or refusing to consider the school&#8217;s application for renewal of its certification to participate in the Title IV programs or for approval to add a new campus or educational program; and &#8226; referring the matter for possible civil or criminal investigation. If Purdue Global or other client institutions lose or have limits placed on their Title IV eligibility, accreditation or state licensure, or if they are subject to fines, repayment obligations or other adverse actions due to their or KHE&#8217;s noncompliance with Title IV regulations, accreditor or state agency requirements or other state or federal laws, KHE&#8217;s financial results of operations could be adversely affected. Compliance reviews and litigation. KHE and its client institutions are subject to reviews, audits, investigations and other compliance reviews conducted by various regulatory agencies and auditors, including, among others, the ED, the ED&#8217;s Office of the Inspector General, accrediting bodies and state and various other federal agencies. These compliance reviews could result in findings of noncompliance with statutory and regulatory requirements that could, in turn, result in the imposition of fines, liabilities, civil or criminal penalties or other sanctions against KHE and its client institutions. Separately, if KHE provides financial aid services to more than one Title IV participating institution, it will be required to arrange for an independent auditor to conduct an annual Title IV compliance audit of KHE&#8217;s compliance with applicable ED requirements. KHE&#8217;s client institutions are also required to arrange for an independent auditor to conduct an annual Title IV compliance audit of their compliance with applicable ED requirements, including requirements related to services provided by KHE. On February 23, 2015, the ED began a program review assessing KU&#8217;s administration of its Title IV and Higher Education Act programs during the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 award years. In 2018, Kaplan contributed the institutional assets and operations of KU to Purdue Global, and the university became Purdue Global, under the ownership and control of Purdue University. However, Kaplan retained liability for any financial obligations the ED may impose under this program review and that were the result of actions taken during the time that Kaplan owned the institution. In September 2018, the ED issued a Preliminary Program Report (Preliminary Report), and in August 2019, the ED issued a Final Program Review Report. Although the program review technically covered only the 2013-2015 award years, the ED also included a review of the treatment of student financial aid refunds for students who withdrew from a program prior to completion in 2017-2018 that KHE had previously reported to the ED and for which Kaplan had returned Title IV aid in 2018. The Final Program Review Report required no further action on this item, although it imposed interest liability in the amount of $118,950 related to the return of that Title IV aid. KHE paid this amount on August 19, 2019, and the matter was closed. No other material item or liability was imposed by the ED in the Final Program Review Report. There were two other open program reviews at campuses that were part of the KHE nationally accredited on-ground Title IV eligible schools business (KHE Campuses) prior to its sale in 2015 to Education Corporation of America (ECA). The ED&#8217;s reports on the program reviews at former KHE Broomall, PA, and Pittsburgh, PA, locations of the KHE Campuses were finalized and closed in the third quarter of 2019, with no financial liability imposed on KHE. On September 3, 2015, Kaplan sold to ECA substantially all of the assets of the KHE Campuses. The transaction included the transfer of certain real estate leases that were guaranteed or purportedly guaranteed by Kaplan. ECA is currently in receivership, has terminated all of its higher education operations and has sold, or is in the process of selling or liquidating, its remaining assets (including New England College of Business). Additionally, the receiver has repudiated all of ECA&#8217;s real estate leases. Although ECA is required to indemnify Kaplan for any amounts Kaplan must pay due to ECA&#8217;s failure to fulfill its obligations under the real estate leases guaranteed by Kaplan, ECA&#8217;s current financial condition and the amount of secured and unsecured creditor claims outstanding against ECA make it unlikely that Kaplan will recover from ECA. In the second half of 2018, the Company recorded an estimated $17.5 million in losses on guarantor lease obligations in connection with this transaction in other non-operating expense. The Company recorded an additional estimated $1.1 million in non-operating expense in 2019, consisting of legal fees and lease costs. The Company continues to monitor the status of these obligations. Kaplan also may be liable to the current owners of KU and the KHE schools related to the pre-sale conduct of the schools. Additionally, the pre-sale conduct of the schools could be the subject of future compliance reviews or lawsuits that could result in monetary liabilities or fines or other sanctions. Kaplan Test Preparation In 2019, Kaplan Test Preparation (KTP) included test preparation, data science education and training and healthcare simulation businesses. Each of these businesses is discussed below. On August 8, 2019, Kaplan acquired the healthcare test preparation assets of Becker Professional Education. Test Preparation. &#160; KTP&#8217;s admissions businesses prepare students under the Kaplan Test Prep, Manhattan Prep and Barron&#8217;s Educational Series brands for a broad range of standardized, high-stakes tests, including the SAT, ACT, LSAT, GMAT, MCAT and GRE. KTP&#8217;s accredited businesses, operating under the Kaplan Prep &#38; Achieve brand, prepare students for licensing exams required to enter certain professions, including nursing, medicine and law. KTP also sells admissions consulting, tutoring and other advising services. In 2019, KTP served over 470,000 students through its programs and related products (such as tutoring, online question banks and online practice tests), excluding sales of test prep books by third-party retailers. KTP programs are taught at 47 Kaplan-branded locations and at numerous other locations, such as hotels, high schools, universities and companies throughout the U.S., including Puerto Rico, as well as in Canada, Mexico and the U.K. KTP also licenses material for certain programs to third parties. KTP&#8217;s programs are offered online, typically in a live online classroom or a self-study format, and in person. Private tutoring services are provided online and, in select markets, in person. KTP includes Kaplan Publishing, which focuses on print and digital test preparation and reference resources sold through retail channels under the Kaplan Test Prep, Manhattan Prep and Barron&#8217;s Educational Series brands. At the end of 2019, Kaplan Publishing had over 1,100 titles in print and digital formats, including more than 250 digital products. In total, KTP prepares students for more than 230 standardized tests, the large majority of which are U.S. focused. Data science. KTP operates Metis, an accredited and licensed data science school and training company with locations in New York, California, Illinois and Washington. Metis operates 12-week data science boot camps in each of its locations and conducts trainings for corporations around the world. Simulation . i-Human Patients provides online, simulated patient interactions for use in training and assessing medical health professionals, which are typically purchased by medical and nursing schools. Kaplan Professional (U.S.) Kaplan Professional (U.S.) (KP) helps professionals obtain certifications, licensures, and designations that enable them to advance their careers. KP collaborates with organizations to solve their talent management challenges through customized corporate learning and development solutions. Through live and online instruction, KP provides test preparation, licensing and continuing education, as well as leadership and professional development programs to businesses and individuals in the accounting, insurance, securities, real estate, financial services, wealth management, engineering and architecture industries. In 2019, KP served approximately 3,100 business-to-business clients, including approximately 160 Fortune 500 companies. In 2019, more than 480,000 students used KP&#8217;s exam preparation offerings. On January 14, 2020, KP acquired certain assets of Bob Hogue School of Real Estate, Inc., a real estate education business located in Florida. Bob Hogue provides live classes focused on preparing students for the Florida real estate licensure exams as well as offering online real-estate continuing education courses. Television Broadcasting Graham Media Group, Inc. (GMG), a subsidiary of the Company, owns seven television stations located in Houston, TX; Detroit, MI; Orlando, FL; San Antonio, TX; Jacksonville, FL; and Roanoke, VA, as well as SocialNewsDesk, a provider of social media management tools designed to connect newsrooms with their users. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to each of the Company&#8217;s television stations: Station, Location and Year Commercial Operation Commenced &#160; National Market Ranking (a) &#160; Primary Network Affiliation &#160; Expiration Date of FCC License &#160; Expiration Date of Network Agreement &#160; Total Commercial Stations in DMA (b) KPRC, Houston, TX, 1949 &#160; 8th &#160; NBC &#160; Aug. 1, 2022 &#160; Dec. 31, 2022 &#160; WDIV, Detroit, MI, 1947 &#160; 14th &#160; NBC &#160; Oct. 1, 2021 &#160; Dec. 31, 2022 &#160; WKMG, Orlando, FL, 1954 &#160; 18th &#160; CBS &#160; Feb. 1, 2021 &#160; June 30, 2022 &#160; KSAT, San Antonio, TX, 1957 &#160; 31st &#160; ABC &#160; Aug. 1, 2022 &#160; Dec. 31, 2021 &#160; WJXT, Jacksonville, FL, 1947 &#160; 41st &#160; None &#160; Feb. 1, 2021 &#160; &#8212; &#160; WCWJ, Jacksonville, FL, 1966 &#160; 41st &#160; CW &#160; Feb. 1, 2021 &#160; Aug. 31, 2021 &#160; WSLS, Roanoke, VA, 1952 &#160; 69th &#160; NBC &#160; Oct. 1 2020 &#160; Dec. 31, 2022 &#160; &#160;_________________________________________________________________________________ (a) Source: 2019\/2020 Local Television Market Universe Estimates, the Nielson Company, September 2019, based on television homes in DMA (see note (b) below). (b) Full-power commercial TV stations, Designated Market Area (DMA) is a market designation of the Nielsen Company that defines each television market exclusive of another, based on measured viewing patterns. Revenue from broadcasting operations is derived primarily from the sale of advertising time to local, regional and national advertisers. In 2019 , advertising revenue accounted for 60.1% of the total for GMG&#8217;s operations. Advertising revenue is sensitive to a number of factors, some specific to a particular station or market and others more general in nature. These factors include a station&#8217;s audience share and market ranking; seasonal fluctuations in demand for air time; annual or biannual events, such as sporting events and political elections; and broader economic trends, among others. Regulation of Broadcasting and Related Matters GMG&#8217;s television broadcasting operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the U.S. Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act). Each GMG television station holds an FCC license that is renewable upon application for an eight-year period. As shown in the chart above, the current terms of the GMG station licenses expire in 2020 through 2022. GMG does not anticipate any issues in renewing its FCC licenses and expects the FCC to grant future renewal applications for its stations in due course, but cannot provide any assurances that the FCC will do so. Digital Television (DTV) and Spectrum Issues. &#160; Each GMG station (and each full-power television station nationwide) broadcasts only in a digital format, which allows transmission of HDTV programming and multiple channels of standard-definition television programming (multicasting). Television stations may receive interference from a variety of sources, including interference from other broadcast stations, that is below a threshold established by the FCC. That interference could limit viewers&#8217; ability to receive television stations&#8217; signals. The amount of interference to stations could increase in the future because of the FCC&#8217;s decision to allow electronic devices, known as &#8220;white space&#8221; devices, to operate in the television frequency band on an unlicensed basis on channels not used by nearby television stations. In November 2017, the FCC voted to adopt rules authorizing broadcast television stations to voluntarily transition to a new technical standard, called Next Generation TV or ATSC 3.0. The new standard is designed to allow broadcasters to provide consumers with better sound and picture quality; hyper-localized programming, including news and weather; enhanced emergency alerts and improved mobile reception. The standard will allow for the use of targeted advertising and more efficient use of spectrum, potentially allowing for more multicast streams to be aired on the same six-megahertz channel. ATSC 3.0 is not backward compatible with existing television equipment, and the FCC&#8217;s rules require full-power television stations that transition to the new standard to continue broadcasting a signal in the existing DTV standard until the FCC phases out the requirement in a future order. A transitioning station&#8217;s DTV-formatted content must be substantially similar to the programming aired on its ATSC 3.0 channel for at least five years. GMG station WDIV (Detroit) is scheduled to commence broadcast of an ATSC 3.0 stream in 2020. As required by the rules, this stream will be in addition to WDIV&#8217;s current DTV stream, which viewers will continue to be able to view as they do today. In April 2017, the FCC announced the completion of an incentive auction in which certain broadcast television stations bid to relinquish spectrum or move to a different spectrum band in exchange for a share of the revenues obtained by auctioning the reallocated broadcast spectrum for use by wireless broadband providers . None of GMG&#8217;s stations participated in the incentive auction. However, certain GMG stations&#8212;specifically, WDIV, WSLS, WCWJ and WJXT&#8212;have been required to move to new channel allotments in order to free up a nationwide block of spectrum for wireless broadband use. The FCC adopted rules requiring this &#8220;repacking&#8221; of broadcast television stations to new channels to be completed within 39 months after the incentive auction closed, with earlier deadlines set for particular stations in order to stagger the transition to new channels. The WSLS transition was completed on September 11, 2019, and the WCWJ and WJXT transitions were completed on January 16, 2020. The only remaining deadline for GMG&#8217;s repacked stations applies to WDIV, which must complete its transition by March 13, 2020 (although GMG has a pending request to extend this deadline to June 16, 2020). The repacking process could have an adverse effect on GMG. For example, the repacking of GMG&#8217;s stations or neighboring stations may result in increased interference to the GMG stations&#8217; signals or otherwise affect the stations&#8217; over-the-air coverage. Although GMG&#8217;s repacked stations are eligible to seek reimbursement for repacking-related costs and have been receiving reimbursement payments through the FCC&#8217;s process, Congress has capped the overall funds available for repack-related reimbursements. The initial legislation authorizing the incentive auction provided only $1.75 billion in total for all such reimbursements. Congress later made available an additional $1 billion in reimbursement funds, with $600 million in available funds allocated to 2018 and $400 million allocated to 2019. To date, each repacked commercial television station, including each of the repacked GMG stations, has been allocated a reimbursement amount equal to approximately 92.5% of the station&#8217;s estimated repacking costs, as verified by the FCC&#8217;s fund administrator. Receipt of the allocated funds is subject to FCC approval of particular requests for reimbursement of actual costs fully incurred. As of February 2020, the repacked GMG stations have received approximately $14.6 million in FCC reimbursements since 2018. Carriage of Local Broadcast Signals. Congress has established, and periodically has extended or otherwise modified, various statutory copyright licensing regimes governing the local and distant carriage of broadcast television signals on cable and satellite systems. The Company cannot predict whether or how Congress may maintain or modify these regimes in the future, or what net effect such decisions would have on the Company&#8217;s broadcast operations or on the Company overall. The Communications Act and the FCC rules allow a commercial television broadcast station, under certain circumstances, to insist on mandatory carriage of its signal on cable systems serving the station&#8217;s market area (must carry). Alternatively, stations may elect, at three-year intervals, to forgo must-carry rights and allow their signals to be carried by cable systems only pursuant to a &#8220;retransmission consent&#8221; agreement. Commercial television stations also may elect either mandatory carriage or retransmission consent with respect to the carriage of their signals on direct broadcast satellite (DBS) systems that provide &#8220;local-into-local&#8221; service (i.e., distribute the signals of local television stations to viewers in the local market area). Stations that elect retransmission consent may negotiate for compensation from cable or DBS systems in exchange for the right to carry their signals. Each of GMG&#8217;s television stations has elected retransmission consent for both cable and DBS operators, and each is carried on all of the major cable and DBS systems serving each station&#8217;s respective local market pursuant to retransmission consent agreements. Retransmission consent elections must be made every three years. The next election deadline is October 1, 2020; all GMG stations again intend to elect retransmission consent for both cable and DBS operators. The next election process will be less time-intensive than prior processes, as the FCC in July 2019 moved to an electronic election system that allows broadcasters to post their carriage elections online and to send notices to covered MVPDs electronically. Recent statutes have required the FCC to modify its rules governing retransmission consent negotiations. Under the STELA Reauthorization Act (STELAR), enacted in December 2014, the FCC adopted rules prohibiting same-market television broadcast stations from coordinating or jointly negotiating for retransmission consent unless such stations are under common control. The Television Viewer Protection Act, enacted on December 20, 2019, made changes to the &#8220;good faith&#8221; standards for retransmission consent negotiations, calling for the FCC to implement regulations requiring &#8220;large station groups&#8221; (groups of television broadcast stations that have a national audience reach of more than 20%) to negotiate in good faith with MVPD &#8220;buying groups&#8221; (entities that negotiate on behalf of multiple small MVPDs). GMG does not qualify as a &#8220;large station group&#8221; under the statute and therefore will not be subject to this obligation. The Satellite Television Community Protection and Promotion Act, also enacted on December 20, 2019, requires DirecTV to provide service to all 210 local markets in order to continue to have a compulsory copyright license for distant signals (DISH already serves all local markets). While GMG does not anticipate that these recent changes will materially affect its bargaining position in retransmission consent negotiations, if Congress or the FCC were to enact further changes to the retransmission consent rules (such as by requiring small station groups like GMG to negotiate with MVPD buying groups, or otherwise giving MVPDs heightened bargaining power), such changes could have a material effect on retransmission consent revenues. The FCC has also considered proposals to alter its rules governing network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity. In March 2014, the FCC solicited comments on a proposal to eliminate its network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules, which restrict the ability of cable operators, direct broadcast satellite systems and other distributors classified by the FCC as MVPDs to import the signals of out-of-market television stations with duplicate programming during retransmission consent disputes or otherwise. The FCC has not acted on that proposal to date. If Congress or the FCC were to enact further changes to the exclusivity rules, such changes could materially affect the GMG stations&#8217; bargaining position in future retransmission consent negotiations. Ownership Limits. &#160; The Communications Act and the FCC &#8217; s rules limit the number and types of media outlets in which a single person or entity may have an attributable interest. The FCC is required by statute to review its media ownership rules (with the exception of the national television ownership rule, discussed below) every four years to determine whether, in light of industry competition, those rules remain necessary in the public interest as the result of competition. This process is referred to as the quadrennial review. In November 2017, the FCC conducted such a review and voted to eliminate certain of its ownership limit restrictions and to modify others. However, this FCC decision was challenged in court, and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals set aside the FCC&#8217;s decision in November 2019. This means that the FCC&#8217;s pre&#8209;November 2017 rules are now back in effect. These rules include: the newspaper\/broadcast cross-ownership rule, which prohibits a single entity from owning a full-power broadcast station and a daily print newspaper in the same local market; the radio\/television cross-ownership rule, which imposes certain limits on the ability to own television and radio stations in the same market (in addition to the separate limits on the number of television or radio stations an entity may own in a given market); a more restrictive local television ownership rule, including the Eight Voices Test (generally prohibiting two commercial television stations in the same market from combining ownership if the transaction would result in fewer than eight independently owned stations remaining in the market) and the presumptive prohibition on transactions that would result in common ownership among the top four ranked stations in the same market; and a rule making certain television joint sales agreements (JSAs) attributable in calculating compliance with the FCC&#8217;s ownership limits. The FCC and industry may appeal the Third Circuit&#8217;s decision to the Supreme Court. The FCC&#8217;s most recent quadrennial review of its media ownership rules was initiated in December 2018, prior to the Third Circuit court&#8217;s decision setting aside the FCC&#8217;s November 2017 rule changes. That proceeding remains open. GMG&#8217;s ability to enter into certain transactions in the future may be affected by the reinstatement of the pre&#8209;November 2017 ownership rules, the outcome of any challenge to the Third Circuit Court&#8217;s decision, and the resolution of the current FCC quadrennial review proceeding. Under the national television ownership rule, a single person or entity may have an attributable interest in an unlimited number of television stations nationwide, as long as the aggregate audience reach of such stations does not exceed 39% of nationwide television households and as long as such interest complies with the FCC&#8217;s other ownership restrictions. In 2016, the FCC eliminated the 50% Ultra High Frequency (UHF) discount, under which stations broadcasting on UHF channels are credited with only half the number of households in their market for purposes of calculating compliance with the 39% cap. However, the FCC reversed that decision in early 2017, concluding that the UHF discount should not be altered except in connection with a broader review of the national ownership cap. The reinstatement of the UHF discount was upheld by the D.C. Circuit in the summer of 2018. In December 2017, the FCC initiated a new rule making proceeding seeking comments regarding its authority to modify or eliminate the national television ownership cap, which was set at 39% by statute, as well as the potential elimination of the UHF discount. The FCC has received comments on its rule making but has not yet issued an order in the proceeding. Programming. &#160; Six of GMG&#8217;s seven stations are affiliated with one or more of the national television networks that provide a substantial amount of programming to their television station affiliates. The expiration dates of GMG&#8217;s affiliation agreements are set forth at the beginning of this Television Broadcasting section. WJXT, one of GMG&#8217;s Jacksonville stations, has operated as an independent station since 2002. In addition, each of the GMG stations receives programming from syndicators and other third-party programming providers. GMG&#8217;s performance depends in part on the quality and availability of third-party programming, and any substantial decline in the quality or availability of this programming could materially affect the ability of GMG and its competitors to enter into certain transactions in the future. Public Interest Obligations. &#160; To satisfy FCC requirements, stations generally are expected to air a specified number of hours of programming intended to serve the educational and informational needs of children and to complete reports on a quarterly basis concerning children&#8217;s programming. In July 2019, the FCC modified these rules to provide broadcasters with more flexibility in meeting the public interest obligations. Among other things, the new rules allow up to 52 hours per year of children&#8217;s programming to consist of educational specials and\/or short-form programming. The prior rules required all qualifying programming to be regularly scheduled and in 30-minute blocks. While stations are required to air the substantial majority of their educational and informational children&#8217;s programming on their primary program stream, under the new rules they may now may air up to 13 hours per quarter of regularly scheduled weekly programming on a multicast stream. In addition, the FCC requires stations to limit the amount of advertising that appears during certain children&#8217;s programs. The FCC has other regulations and policies to ensure that broadcast licensees operate in the public interest, including rules requiring the disclosure of certain information and documents in an online public inspection file; rules requiring the closed-captioning of programming to assist television viewing by the hearing impaired; video description rules to assist television viewing by the visually impaired; rules concerning the captioning of video programming distributed via the Internet; and rules concerning the volume of commercials. Compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on the GMG stations that could affect GMG&#8217;s operations. However, the FCC has taken some measures to reduce burdens related to keeping physical copies of licenses posted and submitting paper copies of contracts, for example. The FCC also has an open proceeding to determine whether to remove other filing requirements. Political Advertising. &#160; The FCC regulates the sale of advertising by GMG&#8217;s stations to candidates for public office and imposes other obligations regarding the broadcast of political announcements more generally. The application of these regulations may limit the advertising revenues of GMG&#8217;s television stations during the periods preceding elections. On October 16, 2019, the FCC admonished GMG because its WDIV station failed to disclose certain sponsorship information and failed to file in a timely manner certain materials in the public inspection file. GMG was one of several station groups so admonished, and GMG received no fines or other consequences as a result of this issue. Broadcast Indecency. &#160; The FCC&#8217;s policies prohibit the broadcast of indecent and profane material during certain hours of the day, and the FCC may impose monetary forfeitures when it determines that a television station has violated that policy. Broadcasters have repeatedly challenged these rules in court, arguing, among other things, that the FCC has failed to justify its indecency decisions adequately, that the FCC&#8217;s policy is too subjective to guide broadcasters&#8217; programming decisions and that its enforcement approach otherwise violates the First Amendment. In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain fines against broadcasters for &#8220;fleeting expletives&#8221; were unconstitutional because the FCC failed to provide advance notice to broadcasters of what the FCC deemed to be indecent, but it also upheld the FCC&#8217;s authority to regulate broadcast decency. The Company cannot predict how GMG&#8217;s stations may be affected by the FCC&#8217;s current or future interpretation and enforcement of its indecency policies. Other Matters. The FCC is conducting proceedings concerning various matters in addition to those described in this section. The outcome of these proceedings and other matters described in this section could adversely affect the profitability of GMG&#8217;s television broadcasting operations. Other Activities Graham Healthcare Group Graham Healthcare Group (GHG) provides home health, hospice and palliative services to more than 50,000 patients annually. GHG operates ten home care, seven hospice and two palliative care operating units in Michigan, Illinois and Pennsylvania. Six of GHG&#8217;s 19 operating units are operated through joint ventures with health systems and physician groups. The remainder are wholly owned and operated under the &#8220;Residential&#8221; brand name. Home health services include a wide range of health and social services delivered at home to recovering, disabled and chronically or terminally ill persons in need of medical, nursing, social or therapeutic treatment and assistance with the essential activities of daily living. Hospice care focuses on relieving symptoms and supporting patients with a life expectancy of six months or less. Hospice care involves an interdisciplinary approach to the provision of medical care, pain management and emotional and spiritual support, with an emphasis on comfort, not curing. Hospice services can be provided in the patient&#8217;s home, as well as in freestanding hospice facilities, hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Palliative care is a specialized form of medicine provided by nurse practitioners that aims to enhance the quality of life of patients and their families who are faced with serious illness. It focuses on increasing comfort through prevention and treatment of distressing symptoms. In addition to expert symptom management, palliative care focuses on clear communication, advance planning and coordination of care. Each GHG operating unit offers care coordination, healthcare solutions and clinical expertise. All home health and hospice operations are Medicare certified and accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC) or are in the process of being ACHC accredited. GHG derives 90% of its revenues for home health and hospice services from Medicare. The remaining sources of revenue are from Medicaid, commercial insurance and private payers.

Each of Kaplan International&#8217;s (KI) businesses competes in disaggregated markets with other for-profit institutions and companies (ranging in size from large for-profit universities to small competitors offering English-language courses) and, in certain instances, with government-supported schools and institutions that provide similar training and educational programs. Competitive factors vary by business and include program offerings, ranking of university partners, convenience, quality of instruction, reputation, placement rates, student services and cost. KI derives its competitive advantage from, among other things, delivering high-quality education and training experiences to students, having name brand recognition across multiple markets, developing strong relationships with corporate clients and recruitment partners and offering competitive pricing. Kaplan Higher Education (KHE) competes with companies that provide technology solutions, administrative support, curriculum development, overall online program development and analytics for colleges and universities, as well as support for corporate, employer and employee education programs. The market for KHE products and services is dynamic and rapidly evolving, and several competitors offer a mix of some of the same products and services or are seeking to move into KHE&#8217;s markets. Competitive factors in KHE&#8217;s markets include the ability to deliver a wide range of educational services and programs to clients across all levels of programs and administrative functions; cost effectiveness; expertise in marketing, recruitment and program delivery; student outcomes and satisfaction; the ability to invest in start-up and scaling initiatives; reputation; and compliance with laws and the ability to navigate complex regulatory requirements. KHE&#8217;s ability to effectively compete will depend in large part on its successful delivery and navigation of these factors . While the competitive landscape is expanding, KHE&#8217;s resources, capabilities and experience are key differentiators in the market. Kaplan Test Preparation ( KTP) competes with a wide range of national, regional, local, online and location-based competitors. Competitors vary by test, with many focused on preparing students for a single high-stakes test. For its curricular and assessment services, KTP has a number of national competitors, including, for example, ATI\/Ascend Learning and HESI\/Elsevier, as well as competitors focused on preparation for particular tests. Competitive factors vary by product line and include price, features, modality, schedule and reputation. Although KTP faces intense competition and shifting consumer preferences, particularly with respect to online test preparation, where some new competitors are offering lower-cost and free test preparation products, KTP remains a leading name in test preparation owing in part to its technical expertise and capabilities, quality of instructors, content, curricula, longevity and reputation in the industry. Kaplan Professional (U.S.) (KP) offers a broad portfolio of products, many within highly regulated and mature industries, including securities, insurance, real estate and wealth management, where competition includes a wide variety of national, regional and local companies seeking the same market share and resulting in deep price discounting and commoditization of offerings. Graham Media Group GMG competes for audiences and advertising revenues with television and radio stations, cable systems, video services offered by telephone and broadband companies serving the same or nearby areas, DBS services, digital media services, and, to a lesser degree, with other media providers, such as newspapers and magazines. Cable systems operate in substantially all of the areas served by the Company&#8217;s television stations, where they compete for television viewers by importing out-of-market television signals; by distributing pay-cable, advertiser-supported and other programming that is originated for cable systems; and by offering movies and other programming on an on-demand, digital or pay-per-view basis. In addition, DBS services provide nationwide distribution of television programming, including pay-per-view programming and programming packages unique to DBS, using digital transmission technologies. Moreover, to the extent that competing television stations in the Company&#8217;s television markets transition to ATSC 3.0, such stations may pose an increased competitive challenge to the Company&#8217;s stations in the future, such as by offering an increased number of multicast channels or by offering advanced features. Competition continues to increase from established and emerging online distribution platforms. Movies and television programming increasingly are available on an on-demand basis through a variety of online platforms, which include free access on the websites of the major TV networks, ad-supported viewing on platforms such as Hulu, and subscription-based access through services such as Netflix. In addition, online-only subscription services offering live television services have been launched both by traditional pay-TV competitors (such as DISH and DirecTV) and new entrants (such as Fubo). The Company has entered into agreements for some of its stations to be distributed via certain of these services, typically through opt-in agreements negotiated by the stations&#8217; affiliated networks. Participation in these services has given the Company&#8217;s stations access to new distribution platforms. At the same time, competition from these various platforms could adversely affect the viewership of the Company&#8217;s television stations via traditional platforms and\/or the Company&#8217;s strategic position in negotiations with pay-TV services. In addition, the networks&#8217; increased role in negotiating online distribution arrangements for their affiliated stations, together with the networks&#8217; imposition of higher fees on affiliated stations in exchange for broadcast and traditional pay-TV retransmission rights, may have broader effects on the overall network-affiliate relationship, which the Company cannot predict. Hoover Hoover&#8217;s predominant product line is fire-retardant treated wood products for building interior applications that are specified by architects in accordance with building code requirements for multi-family residential, commercial and institutional nonresidential buildings. Hoover&#8217;s fire-retardant product lines are sold through a stocking distributor network of more than 100 locations spanning the U.S. and Canada. Hoover&#8217;s competitors are licensees of other chemical suppliers to the wood treating industry who compete with Hoover&#8217;s stocking distributors on a local basis. The primary areas of competition are product availability and price, although brand loyalty due to product quality is significant. Wood products are commodities with volatile market pricing; however, Hoover&#8217;s reputation for quality products and its unique distribution model, which provides superior product availability, enable Hoover to maintain a leading position across the continent. Dekko Dekko has three distinct product families that compete in fragmented, competitive global markets: power and data distribution for office and furniture products, lighting solutions, and electrical harness manufacturing. These products are sold through dealer and distribution channels and OEM customers, focused primarily on the North American market. While all markets and products are price sensitive, technology, engineering solutions, quality and delivery performance are critical in purchase decisions. Dekko&#8217;s multiple long-term relationships, high-quality manufacturing facilities, engineering support and reputation as a solutions provider, in addition to being a product supplier, all contribute to sustaining its competitive advantages. Graham Healthcare Group The home health and hospice industries are extremely competitive and fragmented, consisting of both for-profit and nonprofit companies.

GHG markets its services to physicians, discharge planners and social workers at hospitals, nursing homes, senior living communities and physicians&#8217; offices through a direct sales model. GHG differentiates its offerings based on response time, clinical programming, clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. Throughout the three states in which it operates, GHG competes primarily with both privately owned and hospital-operated home health and hospice service providers. Clyde&#8217;s The restaurant industry is highly competitive. Clyde&#8217;s competes with national and regional chains and independent, locally owned restaurants for customers and personnel. The principal basis for competition are types of food and service, quality, price, location, brand and attractiveness of facilities. Graham Automotive The retail automotive industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Automobile dealerships compete with dealerships offering the same brands as well as those offering other manufacturers&#8217; brands. Competitors include small local dealerships and large national multi-franchise automotive dealership groups. In addition to competition for vehicle sales, dealerships compete for parts and service business with other dealerships, automotive parts retailers and independent mechanics. The principal competitive factors in vehicle sales are price, selection of vehicles, location of dealerships and quality of customer service. The principal competitive factors in parts and service sales are price, the use of factory-approved replacement parts, factory-trained technicians, and the quality of customer service. Slate As a digital media company, Slate operates in highly competitive markets for audiences and advertisers. For written work, Slate faces competition from other online publishers, especially magazines and newspapers. In podcasting, Slate faces competition from other podcast networks, as well as traditional radio networks. In the face of stiff competition, Slate is able to attract a large, educated, affluent audience by creating high-quality content and is then able to compete for advertisers who wish to reach that audience on trusted, brand-safe properties. SocialCode The business of managed digital advertising is highly competitive. Public multinational advertising agencies may exacerbate price competition in an attempt to protect existing relationships with advertising clients in traditional media formats such as television. Public and private advertising technology companies, digital media agencies and newer market entrants such as consulting firms also compete on price, service and technology offerings. SocialCode seeks to maintain a competitive advantage and maximize its clients&#8217; return on advertising budgets by utilizing a combination of the deep expertise of its employees, who manage media spending on the largest digital platforms; a proprietary software (SaaS) as a service platform, allowing clients to make better use of first-party and third-party data to increase advertising effectiveness; and a full - service creative team with a nuanced understanding of digital media. Megaphone Megaphone provides podcast technology for publishers and advertisers through the Megaphone platform and Megaphone Targeted Marketplace (MTM). Megaphone, a proprietary SaaS platform, provides hosting and dynamic advertising insertion for publishers. Megaphone operates in a small but competitive market and competes primarily on the basis of product performance, price and service. Megaphone&#8217;s differentiators include an intuitive user experience, dynamic advertising insertion, advertising operations tools, customer service and proprietary audience-targeting technology. MTM operates in the nascent market for targeted advertising in podcasting and is the pioneer of this technology. MTM&#8217;s proprietary dynamic advertising insertion technology combined with data from the Nielsen Marketing Cloud platform allows brand advertisers to target more than 60,000 segments based on demographics, interests, behavioral traits and purchase intent.

Business &#160;Historical Background &#160;We were incorporated in the State of New Jersey on October 1, 2003 under the name of Creative Beauty Supply of New Jersey Corporation and subsequently changed our name to Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc. on May 18, 2015. We commenced operations in the beauty supply industry as of January 1, 2004. On November 30, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose of our wholesale and retail beauty supply business. From January 1, 2009 until July 28, 2017, we had no operations and were a shell company.&#160;On March 16, 2017, our Board of Directors adopted resolutions, which were approved by shareholders holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to change our name to &#8220;IIOT-OXYS, Inc.&#8221;, to authorize a change of domicile from New Jersey to Nevada, to authorize a 2017 Stock Awards Plan, and to approve the Securities Exchange Agreement (the &#8220; OXYS SEA &#8221;) between the Company and OXYS Corporation (&#8220; OXYS &#8221;), a Nevada corporation incorporated on August 4, 2016.&#160;Under the terms of the OXYS SEA we acquired 100% of our issued voting shares of OXYS in exchange for 34,687,244 shares of our Common Stock. We also cancelled 1,500,000 outstanding shares of our Common Stock and changed our management to Mr. DiBiase who also served in management of OXYS. Also, one of our principal shareholders entered into a consulting agreement with OXYS to provide consulting services during the transition. The OXYS SEA was effective on July 28, 2017, and our name was changed to &#8220;IIOT-OXYS, Inc.&#8221; at that time. Effective October 26, 2017, our domicile was changed from New Jersey to Nevada.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 4 &#160; &#160;&#160;On December 14, 2017, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the &#8220; HereLab SEA &#8221;) with HereLab, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220; HereLab &#8221;), and HereLab&#8217;s two shareholders pursuant to which we would acquire all the issued and outstanding shares of HereLab in exchange for the issuance of 1,650,000 shares of our Common Stock, on a pro rata basis, to HereLab&#8217;s two shareholders. The closing of the transaction occurred on January 11, 2018 and HereLab became our wholly-owned subsidiary.&#160;A new management team was put into place in 2018, which constitutes our current management team.&#160;At the present time, we have two, wholly-owned subsidiaries which are OXYS Corporation and HereLab, Inc., through which our operations are conducted.&#160;General Overview &#160;IIOT-OXYS, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the &#8220; Company &#8221;), and OXYS, were originally established for the purposes of designing, building, testing, and selling Edge Computing systems for the Industrial Internet. Both companies were, and presently are, early stage technology startups that are largely pre-revenue in their development phase. HereLab is also an early-stage technology development company. The Company received its first revenues in the last quarter of 2017, continued to realize revenues during 2018 and 2019, and expects to realize revenue growth in 2020 due to its business development pipeline.&#160;We develop hardware, software and algorithms that monitor, measure and predict conditions for energy, structural, agricultural and medical applications. We use domain-specific Artificial Intelligence to solve industrial and environmental challenges. Our engineered solutions focus on common sense approaches to machine learning, algorithm development and hardware and software products.&#160;Our customers have issues and they need improvements. We design a system of hardware and software, assemble, install, monitor data and apply our algorithms to help provide the customer insights.&#160;We use off the shelf components, with reconfigurable hardware architecture that adapts to a wide range of customer needs and applications. We use open source software tools, while still creating proprietary content for customers, thereby reducing software development time and cost. The software works with the hardware to collect data from the equipment or structure that is being monitored.&#160;We focus on developing insights. We develop algorithms that help our customers create insights from vast data streams. The data collected is analyzed and reports are created for the customer. From these insights, the customer can act to improve their process, product or structure.&#160;OUR SOLUTIONS ACHIEVE TWO OBJECTIVES &#160;ADD VALUE &#160;&#160; &#183; We show clear path to improved asset reliability, machine uptime, machine utilization, energy consumption, and quality. &#160; &#183; We provide advanced algorithms and insights as a service. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 5 &#160; &#160;&#160;RISK MINIMIZATION &#160;&#160; &#183; We use simple measurements requiring almost zero integration &#8211; minimally invasive. &#160; &#183; We do not interfere with command and control of critical equipment. &#160; &#183; We do not physically touch machine control networks &#8211; total isolation of networks. &#160;HOW WE DO IT &#160;Our location in Cambridge, Massachusetts is ideal since market-leading Biotech, Medtech, and Pharma multinational firms have offices or R&#38;D centers in Cambridge or the Greater Boston area, which gives us easier access to potential sales which, in turn, lowers out cost of sales. Additionally, we continue to add value to structural health monitoring and smart manufacturing customers as well. We, therefore, have a range of opportunities as we continue to expand our customer base.&#160;Our goal is to help Biotech, Pharma, and Medical Device companies realize the next wave of performance, productivity, and quality gains for their organizations, and become Industry 4.0 compliant.&#160;We have a unique value proposition in a fast-growing worldwide multi-billion USD market, and have positioned with strategic partners for accelerated growth. We are therefore well-poised for rapid growth in 2019 and beyond, as we execute our plans and quickly acquire additional customers.&#160;WHAT MARKETS WE SERVE &#160;SMART MANUFACTURING &#160;We help our customers maintain machine uptime and maximize operational efficiency. We also enable then to do energy monitoring, predictive maintenance that anticipates problems before they happen, and improve part and process quality.&#160;BIOTECH, PHARMACEUTICAL, AND MEDICAL DEVICES &#160;We are on the operations side, not the patient-facing side. In this market vertical, our customers must provide high-quality products that must also pass rigorous review by governing bodies such as the FDA. Here again, we focus on machine uptime, operational efficiency, and predictive maintenance to avoid unplanned downtime.&#160;SMART INFRASTRUCTURE &#160;For bridges and other civil infrastructure, local, state and federal agencies have limited resources. We help our clients prioritize how to spend limited funds by addressing those fixes which need to be made first.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 6 &#160; &#160;&#160;OUR UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION &#160;EDGE COMPUTING AS A COMPLIMENT TO CLOUD COMPUTING &#160;Within the Internet of Things (&#8220; IoT &#8221;) and Industrial Internet of Things (&#8220; IIoT &#8221;), most companies right now are adopting an approach which sends all sensor data to the cloud for processing. We specialize in edge computing, where the data processing is done locally right where the data is collected. We also have advanced cloud-based algorithms that implement various machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms.&#160;ADVANCED ALGORITHMS &#160;We have sought to differentiate from our competitors by developing advanced algorithms on our own and in collaboration with world-leading research institutions. These algorithms are an essential part of the edge computing strategy that convert raw data into actionable knowledge right where the data is collected without having to send the data to the cloud first.&#160;RECONFIGURABLE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE &#160;Instead of focusing on creating tools, we use open source tools to create proprietary content.&#160;PROGRESS IN 2020 &#160;Marketing &#160; Our marketing and sales efforts are divided into several distinct categories:&#160;&#160; 1) Working with technical partners who have larger sales forces; &#160; 2) Direct business development and discussions with end use customers by company management; and &#160; 3) Trade shows and international technical, sales and marketing meetings. &#160;Competition &#160;We have two principal sources of competition. The first comes from large companies such as IBM, GE, Amazon, Google, etc., who all have their efforts in IIoT. However, these large companies are cloud &#8211; computing centric and they are trying to move towards edge devices from their present position of being solely cloud computing based. We will be starting in edge computing from day one as opposed to force-fitting a cloud-based solution into the limited computational capability and storage space of an edge device. We believe our systems will be more computationally efficient as compared to a cloud-based solution which requires more computational resources.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 7 &#160; &#160;&#160;Most of the IIoT implementations involve data going from sensor to cloud. This involves sending vast amounts of data to the cloud and then processing the data there. This requires a large computational footprint (many processors) and a large memory requirement to store the data. From our actual experience and according to many technical experts in the field (see for example the discussion on edge data in &#8220;Structural Health Monitoring&#8221; A Machine Learning Perspective,&#8221; by C.R. Farrar and K. Worden, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 2013), a better approach is to use Edge Computing. Edge Computing takes the raw data, which could be MB or GB per second, and extracts features. Features are attributes of the signal that preserve the essential physics of the signal but reduce the data density by a very large amount (up to a factor of one million). After the feature extraction step, the data has a data rate of approximately 10KB or 100KB per second. Next comes the classification step, which further reduces data by classifying data into at least two bins: nominal behavior or off-nominal or abnormal behavior. For example, in monitoring a machine tool in a factory, if the machine tool is behaving normally, there is nothing to report and therefore no data needs to be sent or transferred anywhere. Only the abnormal condition data needs to be sent along with a description of the problem. This is what Edge Computing accomplishes and it accomplishes this right where the data is being collected using relatively small computational and memory resources (For example our systems have a 1GHz processor and one few GB of RAM plus up to 32 GB of storage &#8211; which is less computational power than the average smart phone.). so considering all of these technical aspects, we are able to assert that our Edge Computing process is more efficient in terms of computational power and memory as compared to a cloud-based solution, that it only sends along the information (not just data) that is really needed, and it can still interact with cloud based services to provide data sharing across different platforms.&#160;The second source of competition is from startups who are in the edge computing space. The most prominent example is FogHorn Systems Inc. There will be additional startups that will specifically target the edge computing space as the investor awareness and the technical focus shifts from cloud computing to edge computing. Whereas other startups focus on development of proprietary tools for edge computing, our solutions will use open source tools but will still create proprietary algorithms and software content for clients and customers. We feel this methodology of creating proprietary solutions using open source tools will allow us to rapidly address current and future customer needs.&#160; Government Regulation &#160;At present, we do not require any governmental approvals of any of our products or services.&#160;Environmental Laws &#160;At present, we are not regulated by any environmental laws.&#160;Research and Development &#160;Other than expenses for legal, accounting, audit, tax preparation, intellectual property (IP), and other overhead expenses such rent, most of our funds are spent on technology development, product development, and research and development. We are an emerging growth, early-stage, technology company and, as such, most of our expenditures are aimed at innovation and product development.&#160;We have a technology maturation model so that we avoid doing work on technologies that are too early and too new and belong in a pure search environment. When the technology is ready to leave the lab, we take over the further development. Along the way we expect to file additional IP and otherwise protect technology by using trademarks, for example.&#160;The efforts in research and development have already resulted in significant customer interest in various market verticals including industrial, automotive, aerospace, agricultural, infrastructure, and power generation.&#160;All the present projects that we are working on internally as research and development projects will go forward, so we do not have any projects in the category of projects that have incurred significant expense but that will not result in present or future product.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 8 &#160; &#160;&#160;Intellectual Property &#160;On February 5, 2018, we entered into a Non-Exclusive Patent License Agreement with MIT. The agreement, which was effective February 1, 2018, granted to us a royalty-bearing non-exclusive license under U.S. Patent Nos. 8344724 (&#8220;Non-Intrusive Monitoring of Power and Other Parameters&#8221; issued January 1, 2013), 14\/263407 (&#8220;Non-Intrusive Monitoring&#8221; filed April 28, 2014), and Patent Cooperation Treaty Serial No. PCT\/US2016\/057165 (&#8220;Noncontact Power Sensing&#8221; filed October 14, 2016) during the term of the agreement. The term of the agreement was from the effective date until the expiration or abandonment of all issued patents and filed patent applications licensed pursuant to the agreement, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the agreement.&#160;Under the agreement, we were required to make a first commercial sale of a &#8220;LICENSED PRODUCT&#8221; and\/or a first commercial performance of a &#8220;LICENSED PROCESS,&#8221; as defined in the agreement, on or before September 30, 2018. We had negotiated revenue targets with MIT which would determine annual royalty payments. The 2018 minimum revenue target for the sale of products and services incorporating the MIT technology was $100,000. This minimum revenue amount would increase in subsequent years.&#160;Within 30 days of invoicing, a non-refundable license issue fee of $10,000 was paid by us to MIT. Pursuant to the agreement, we were required to pay to MIT additional patent maintenance fees in years beyond 2018.&#160;Pursuant to the agreement, we were required to pay to MIT a running royalty of 2% of &#8220;NET SALES,&#8221; as defined in the agreement made in the calendar years 2018, 2019, and 2020. For &#8220;NET SALES&#8221; made in the calendar year 2021 and every calendar year thereafter through the term of the agreement, we were required to pay to MIT a running royalty of 4%.&#160;On October 31, 2018, we sent written notice of our intent to terminate the agreement with an effective date of termination of April 30, 2019. Since none of the technology licensed to us by MIT had been used by us in any of our products and we had been investing in the development of our own intellectual property, we determined the technology that was licensed from MIT wasn&#8217;t necessary in the near term. Due to this, the written notice sent by us expressed a desire by our management to renegotiate the terms of the agreement with MIT.&#160;MIT declined to renegotiate the terms of the agreement and, on December 6, 2018, we received a notice of termination from MIT due to non-payment of fees. As of December 6, 2018, the agreement was terminated, fees are no longer accruing, interest is accruing and $71,352 in fees owed to MIT are still owing as of the date of this Annual Report. Despite the termination of the Agreement, we remain active with MIT as a member of the MIT Startup Exchange (STEX). The purpose of STEX is to promote collaboration and partnerships between MIT-connected startups and members of MIT&#8217;s Industrial Liaison Program. We remain open to future mutually acceptable agreements with MIT . &#160;We continue to develop our proprietary algorithms and plan to protect them through a combination of trade secret, copyright, and patents.&#160;Customers &#160;Due to our status of a start-up, at the moment, we depend on a few major customers. This should change as we implement plans for future growth.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 9 &#160; &#160;&#160;Employees &#160;We had one full time employee in 2019; however, we had contractor employees (1099 basis) who were working daily on the core business activities of the business and have been doing so since the beginning of the business formation. As of April 23, 2020, we have five employees, all on W2&#8217;s, including the CEO, COO and CTO. All employees are currently part time.&#160;At the present time, except for the funding received from Cambridge MedSpace LLC and Vidhyadhar Mitta in the form of secured notes, there are no conflicts of interest between the Company and any of our officers and directors. This was determined as follows: i) none of their outside activities are soliciting business from our customers or business contacts; ii) they are not soliciting our investors to invest in other ventures; and iii) they are not soliciting our contract employees to leave us and join other efforts. At present, all our business services are provided by outside contractors.&#160;","18":" Item 1. Business &#160; General &#160; We are a New York-based real estate finance company that specializes in originating, servicing and managing a portfolio of first mortgage loans. We offer short-term, secured, non-banking loans (sometimes referred to as &#8220;hard money&#8221; loans), which we may renew or extend on, before or after their initial term expires, to real estate investors to fund their acquisition, renovation, rehabilitation or improvement of properties located in the New York metropolitan area, including New Jersey and Connecticut, and in Florida. We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes (&#8220;REIT&#8221;). We have qualified for taxation as a REIT beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. &#160; We are organized as a New York corporation and operated as a fully-taxable C-corporation for federal and state income tax purposes through the end of our 2013 tax year. As a result, we were able to re-invest most of our net after-tax profits back into our business. In 2014, we concluded that it would be in the best interests of our shareholders if we operated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In July 2014, we completed a public offering of 1,754,386 common shares to the public. As a result of that offering, we met all the requirements to qualify as a REIT and elected REIT status starting with that year. &#160; In order to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our shareholders each year. To the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income to our shareholders (but more than 90%) we will maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, but the undistributed portion will be subject to regular corporate income taxes. As a REIT, we may also be subject to federal excise taxes and minimum state taxes. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;). In addition, in order for us to qualify for taxation as a REIT, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding common shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;) to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year, and at least 100 persons must beneficially own our stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate portion of a shorter taxable year. To help ensure that we meet the tests, our restated certificate of incorporation restricts the acquisition and ownership of our capital stock. The ownership limitation is fixed at 4.0% of our outstanding shares of capital stock, by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive. &#160; The properties securing the loans are generally classified as residential or commercial real estate and, typically, are not income producing. Each loan is secured by a first mortgage lien on real estate. In addition, each loan is personally guaranteed by the principal(s) of the borrower, which guarantee may be collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor&#8217;s interest in the borrower. The face amount of the loans we originated in the past seven years ranged from $30,000 to a maximum of $2.5 million. Our lending policy limits the maximum amount of any loan to the lower of (i) 9.9% of the aggregate amount of our loan portfolio (not including the loan under consideration) and (ii) $3 million. Our loans typically have a maximum initial term of 12 months and bear interest at a fixed rate of 9% to 14% per year. In addition, we usually receive origination fees or &#8220;points&#8221; ranging from 0% to 2% of the original principal amount of the loan as well as other fees relating to underwriting and funding the loan. Interest is always payable monthly, in arrears. In the case of acquisition financing, the principal amount of the loan usually does not exceed 75% of the value of the property (as determined by an independent appraiser) and in the case of construction financing, it is typically up to 80% of construction costs. &#160; &#160; &#160; Since commencing our business in 2007, we have never foreclosed on a property and none of our loans have ever gone into default, although sometimes we have renewed or extended the term of a loan to enable the borrower to avoid premature sale or refinancing of the property. When we renew or extend a loan we generally receive additional &#8220;points&#8221; and other fees. &#160; Our executive officers are experienced in hard money lending under various economic and market conditions. Loans are originated, underwritten and structured by our Chief Executive Officer, assisted by our Chief Financial Officer, and then managed and serviced principally by our Chief Financial Officer and our internal team. A principal source of new transactions has been repeat business from prior customers and their referral of new business. We also receive leads for new business from real estate brokers and mortgage brokers and a limited amount of advertising. &#160; Our primary business objective is to grow our loan portfolio while protecting and preserving capital in a manner that provides for attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders over the long term through dividends. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to selectively originate, fund loans secured by first mortgages on residential real estate held for investment located in the New York metropolitan area, including New Jersey and Connecticut, and in Florida, and to carefully manage and service our portfolio in a manner designed to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. We believe that current market dynamics specifically the demand\/supply imbalance for relatively small real estate loans, presents opportunities for us to selectively originate high-quality first mortgage loans and we believe that these market conditions should persist for a number of years. We have built our business on a foundation of intimate knowledge of the New York metropolitan area real estate market combined with a disciplined credit and due diligence culture that is designed to protect and preserve capital. We believe that our flexibility and ability to structure loans that address the needs of our borrowers without compromising our standards on credit risk, our expertise, our intimate knowledge of the New York metropolitan area real estate market and our focus on newly originated first mortgage loans, has defined our success until now and should enable us to continue to achieve our objectives. &#160; The Market Opportunity &#160; Real estate investment is a capital-intensive business that relies heavily on debt capital to acquire, develop, improve, construct, renovate and maintain properties. We believe that the demand for relatively small loans to acquire, renovate or improve residential real estate held around the New York metropolitan area, including New Jersey and Connecticut, and in Florida markets presents a compelling opportunity to generate attractive returns for an established, well-financed, non-bank lender like us. We have competed successfully in these markets notwithstanding the fact that many traditional lenders, such as banks and other institutional lenders, also service this market. Our primary competitive advantage is our ability to approve and fund loans quickly and efficiently. In this environment, characterized by a supply-demand imbalance for financing and increasing asset values, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize and profit from these industry trends. &#160; &#160; &#160;We believe there is a significant market opportunity for a well-capitalized &#8220;hard money&#8221; real estate finance company to originate attractively priced loans with strong credit fundamentals. Particularly around the New York metropolitan area where real estate values are relatively stable and substandard properties are being improved, rehabilitated and renovated, we believe there are many opportunities for a &#8220;hard money&#8221; lender providing capital for these purposes to small scale developers. We further believe that our flexibility to structure loans to suit the particular needs of our borrowers and our ability to close quickly make us an attractive alternative to banks and other large institutional lenders for small real estate developers and investors. &#160; Our Business and Growth Strategies &#160; Our objective is to protect and preserve capital in a manner that provides for attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders over the long term, principally through dividends. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to focus exclusively on selectively originating, servicing and managing a portfolio of short-term real estate loans secured by first mortgages on real estate located in the New York metropolitan area, including New Jersey and Connecticut, and in Florida, that are designed to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. We believe that our ability to react quickly to the needs of borrowers, our flexibility in terms of structuring loans to meet the needs of borrowers, our intimate knowledge of the New York metropolitan area real estate market, our expertise in &#8220;hard money&#8221; lending and our focus on newly originated first mortgage loans, should enable us to achieve this objective. Nevertheless, we will remain flexible in order to take advantage of other real estate related opportunities that may arise from time to time, whether they relate to the mortgage market or, if we determine that it is in our best interest, to make direct or indirect investments in real estate. &#160; Our strategy to achieve our objective includes the following: &#160; &#160; &#9679; capitalize on opportunities created by the long-term structural changes in the real estate lending market and the continuing demand for liquidity in the real estate market; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; take advantage of the prevailing economic environment as well as economic, political and social trends that may impact real estate lending currently and in the future as well as the outlook for real estate in general and particular asset classes; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; remain flexible in order to capitalize on changing sets of investment opportunities that may be present in the various points of an economic cycle; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; operate so as to qualify for taxation as a REIT and for an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act. &#160; In furtherance of these strategies, we have a credit line agreement with Webster Business Credit Corporation (&#8220;Webster&#8221;), Flushing Bank (&#8220;Flushing&#8221;), and Mizrahi Tefahot Bank Ltd. (&#8220;Mizrahi&#8221;) whereby Webster, Flushing and Mizrahi have extended us a $32.5 million credit line. &#160; Our Competitive Strengths &#160; We believe our competitive strengths include: &#160; &#160; &#9679; Experienced management team. Our management team has successfully originated and serviced a portfolio of real estate mortgage loans generating attractive annual returns under varying economic and real estate market conditions. We expect that the experience of our management team will provide us with the ability to effectively deploy our capital in a manner that we believe will provide for attractive risk-adjusted returns but with a focus on capital preservation and protection. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Long-standing relationships. A significant portion of our business comes from repeat customers with whom we have long-standing relationships. These customers are also a referral source for new borrowers. As long as these customers remain active real estate investors they provide us with an advantage in securing new business and help us maintain a pipeline to attractive new opportunities that may not be available to many of our competitors or to the general market. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Knowledge of the market. Our intimate knowledge of the real estate markets in the geographic areas in which we operate enhances our ability to identify attractive opportunities and helps distinguish us from many of our competitors. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Disciplined lending. We seek to maximize our risk-adjusted returns, and preserve and protect capital, through our disciplined and credit-based approach. We utilize rigorous underwriting and loan closing procedures that include numerous checks and balances to evaluate the risks and merits of each potential transaction. We seek to protect and preserve capital by carefully evaluating the condition of the property, the location of the property, and the creditworthiness of the guarantors. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Vertically-integrated loan origination platform. We manage and control the loan process from origination through closing with our own personnel and independent legal counsel and appraisers, with whom we have long relationships, who together constitute a highly experienced team in credit evaluation, underwriting and loan structuring. We also believe that our procedures and experience allow us to quickly and efficiently execute opportunities we deem desirable. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Structuring flexibility. As a relatively small, non-bank real estate lender, we can move quickly and have much more flexibility than traditional lenders to structure loans to suit the needs of our clients. Our ability to customize financing structures to meet borrowers&#8217; needs is one of our key business strengths. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; No legacy issues. Unlike many of our competitors, we are not burdened by distressed legacy real estate assets. We do not have a legacy portfolio of lower-return or problem loans that could potentially dilute the attractive returns we believe are available in the current liquidity-challenged environment and\/or distract and monopolize our management team&#8217;s time and attention. We do not have any adverse credit exposure to, and we do not anticipate that our performance will be negatively impacted by, previously purchased assets. &#160; Our Real Estate Lending Activities &#160; Our real estate lending activities involve originating, funding, servicing and managing short-term loans (i.e.: loans with an initial term of not more than one year), secured by first mortgage liens on real estate property located in the New York metropolitan area, including New Jersey and Connecticut, and in Florida, held for investment or resale. Generally, borrowers use the proceeds from our loans for one of three purposes: (i) to acquire and renovate existing residential (single, one or two family) real estate properties; (ii) to acquire vacant real estate and construct residential real properties; and (iii) to purchase and hold income producing properties. Our mortgage loans are structured to fit the needs and business plans of the borrowers. Revenue is generated primarily from the interest borrowers pay on our loans and, to a lesser extent, loan fee income generated on the origination and extension of loans. &#160; Most of our loans are funded in full at the closing. However, our loan portfolio includes a number of construction loans, which are only partially funded at closing. At December 31, 2018, our unfunded commitment was approximately $7.27 million. At December 31, 2019, our unfunded commitment was approximately $5.07 million. Advances under construction loans are funded against requests supported by all required documentation as and when needed to pay contractors and other costs of construction. In the case of construction loans, the borrower will either deliver multiple notes or one global note for the entire commitment. In either case, interest only accrues on the funded portion of the loan. &#160; &#160; &#160; In general, our strategy is to service and manage the loans we originate until they are paid. However, there have been a few instances where we have either used loans as collateral, or sold participating interests in loans. At December 31, 2019, most of our loans are secured by properties located around the New York metropolitan area. Most of the properties we finance are residential, although on occasion they are classified as commercial. However, in all instances the properties are held only for investment by the borrowers. Most of these properties do not generate any cash flow. &#160; The typical terms of our loans are as follows: &#160; Principal amount &#8211; In the last seven years, a minimum of $30,000 to a maximum of $2.5 million. Our lending policy limits the maximum loan amount to the lower of (i) 9.9% of the aggregate amount of our loan portfolio (not including the loan under consideration) and (ii) $3 million. &#160; Loan-to-Value Ratio - Up to 75%, and\/or up to 80% of construction costs. &#160; Interest rate - Most of the loans in our portfolio have a fixed rate of typically 9% to 14%. &#160; Term - Generally, one year with early termination in the event of a sale of the property or a refinancing. We entertain requests for granting extensions under certain conditions. &#160; Prepayments - Borrower may prepay the loan at any time beginning three months after the funding date and in some instances, we waive prepayment fees. &#160; Covenants - To timely pay all interest on the loan and to maintain hazard insurance with respect to the property. &#160; Events of default - Include: (i) failure to comply with the loan terms; (ii) breach of a covenant. &#160; Payment terms - Interest only is payable monthly in arrears. Principal is due in a &#8220;balloon&#8221; payment at the maturity date. &#160; Escrow - None. &#160; Reserves - None. &#160; Security - The loan is evidenced by a promissory note, which is secured by a first mortgage lien on the real property owned by the borrower. In addition, each loan is guaranteed by the principals of the borrower, which may be collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor&#8217;s interest in the borrower. &#160; Fees and Expenses - Borrowers generally pay an origination fee equal to 0% to 2% of the loan amount. If we agree to extend the term of the loan, we usually collect the same origination fee we charged on the initial funding of the loan. In addition, borrowers in some cases also pay a processing fee, wire fee, bounced check fee and, in the case of construction loans, check requisition fee for each draw from the loan. Finally, the borrower pays all expenses relating to obtaining the loan including the cost of a property appraisal, and all title, recording fees and legal fees. &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating Data &#160; The decline in interest rates has adversely impacted our income and earnings notwithstanding an increase in lending activity. Recent market conditions, including interest rate reductions, intense competition and slowing real estate markets in the areas we operate, have caused a reduction in our margins. &#160; Our loan portfolio &#160; The following table highlights certain information regarding our real estate lending activities for the periods indicated: &#160; &#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; ($ in thousands) &#160; &#160; 2019 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2018 &#160; Loans originated &#160; $ 48,054 &#160; &#160; $ 51,859 &#160; Loans repaid &#160; $ 49,420 &#160; &#160; $ 42,147 &#160; Mortgage lending revenues &#160; $ 7,340 &#160; &#160; $ 7,225 &#160; Mortgage lending expenses &#160; $ 1,639 &#160; &#160; $ 1,701 &#160; Number of loans outstanding &#160; &#160; 135 &#160; &#160; &#160; 132 &#160; Principal amount of loans earning interest &#160; $ 53,485 &#160; &#160; $ 54,836 &#160; Average outstanding loan balance &#160; $ 396 &#160; &#160; $ 415 &#160; Percent of loans secured by New York metropolitan area properties, including in New Jersey and Connecticut (1) &#160; &#160; 99.26 % &#160; &#160; 100 % Weighted average contractual interest rate &#160; &#160; 10.91 % &#160; &#160; 11.38 % Weighted average term to maturity (in months) (2) &#160; &#160; 5.21 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5.52 &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; (1) Calculated based on the number of loans. &#160; (2) Without giving effect to extension options. &#160; At December 31, 2019 and 2018, no single loan, borrower or group of affiliated borrowers accounted for more than 10% of our loan portfolio. &#160; The following table sets forth information regarding the types of properties securing our mortgage loans outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the interest earned in each category (dollars in thousands): &#160; &#160; &#160; 2019 &#160; &#160; 2018 &#160; &#160; &#160; Number of Loans &#160; &#160; Interest Earned &#160; &#160; Percentage &#160; &#160; Number of Loans &#160; &#160; Interest Earned &#160; &#160; Percentage &#160; Residential &#160; &#160; 123 &#160; &#160; $ 3,252 &#160; &#160; &#160; 88 % &#160; &#160; 113 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,262 &#160; &#160; &#160; 86 % Commercial &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 187 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; &#160; &#160; 295 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % Mixed Use &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 269 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 % &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; &#160; &#160; 247 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % Total &#160; &#160; 135 &#160; &#160; $ 3,708 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100 % &#160; &#160; 132 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,804 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100 % &#160; &#160; &#160; Our Origination Process and Underwriting Criteria &#160; We primarily rely on our relationships with existing and former borrowers, real estate investors, real estate brokers, loan initiators, and mortgage brokers to originate loans. Many of our borrowers are &#8220;repeat customers.&#8221; When underwriting a loan, the primary focus of our analysis is the value of a property and the credit worthiness of the borrower and its principals. Prior to making a final decision on a loan application we conduct extensive due diligence of the borrower and its principals. In terms of the property, we require an assessment report and evaluation. We also order title, lien and judgment searches. In most cases, we will also make an on-site visit to evaluate not only the property but the neighborhood in which it is located. Finally, we analyze and assess financial and operational data provided by the borrower relating to its operation and maintenance of the property. In terms of the borrower and its principals, we usually obtain third party credit reports from one of the major credit reporting services as well as personal financial information provided by the borrower and its principals. We analyze all this information carefully prior to making a final determination. Ultimately, our decision is based on our conclusions regarding the value of the property, which takes into account factors such as the neighborhood in which the property is located, the current use and potential alternative use of the property, current and potential net income from the property, the local market, sales information of comparable properties, existing zoning regulations, the creditworthiness of the borrower and its principals and their experience in real estate ownership, construction, development and management. In conducting our due diligence we rely, in part, on third party professionals and experts including appraisers, engineers, title insurers and attorneys. &#160; Before a loan commitment is issued, the loan must be reviewed and approved by our Chief Executive Officer. Our loan commitments are generally issued subject to receipt by us of title documentation and title report, in a form satisfactory to us, for the underlying property. We require a personal guarantee from the principal or principals of the borrower. &#160; Our Current Financing Strategies &#160; Our financing strategies are critical to the success and growth of our business. Our financing strategies at this time are limited to equity and debt offerings, as well as lines of credit from banks. Our principal capital raising transactions have consisted of the following: &#160; Credit line . Currently, we have a credit line with Webster, Flushing, and Mizrahi pursuant to which we are eligible to borrow up to $32.5 million against assignments of mortgages and other collateral (the &#8220;Webster Credit Line&#8221;), as described in &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; below. The current interest rates under the Webster Credit Line equal (i) LIBOR plus a premium, which rate aggregated 5.76%, including a 0.5% agency fee, as of December 31, 2019, or (ii) a Base Rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus 2.25% plus a 0.5% agency fee, as chosen by the Company for each drawdown. (See Note 5 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Report.) &#160; The following table shows our capitalization, including our financing arrangements, and our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2019: &#160; Capitalization ($ in thousands): &#160; &#160; &#160; Debt: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Line of credit &#160; $ 15,233 &#160; Senior secured notes (net of deferred financing costs of $472) &#160; &#160; 5,528 &#160; Total debt &#160; $ 20,761 &#160; Other liabilities &#160; &#160; 1,739 &#160; Capital (equity) &#160; &#160; 31,943 &#160; Total sources of capital &#160; $ 54,443 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Assets: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Loans &#160; $ 53,485 &#160; Other assets &#160; &#160; 958 &#160; Total assets &#160; $ 54,443 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Competition &#160; The real estate finance market around the New York metropolitan area is highly competitive. We face competition for lending and investment opportunities from a variety of institutional lenders and investors and many other market participants, including specialty finance companies, mortgage\/other REITs, commercial banks and thrift institutions, investment banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and other financial institutions as well as private equity funds, family offices and high net worth individuals. Many of these competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, including greater name recognition, established lending relationships with customers, financial resources, and access to capital. &#160; Notwithstanding the intense competition and some of our competitive disadvantages, we believe we have carved a niche for ourselves among small real estate developers, owners and contractors throughout the New York metropolitan area because of our ability to structure each loan to suit the needs of each individual borrower and our ability to act quickly. In addition, we believe we have developed a reputation among these borrowers as offering reasonable terms and providing outstanding customer service. We believe our future success will depend on our ability to maintain and capitalize on our existing relationships with borrowers and brokers and to expand our borrower base by continuing to offer attractive loan products, remain competitive in pricing and terms, and provide superior service. &#160; In addition, we have also begun operating in the New Jersey, Connecticut and Florida markets. As we have not operated in those markets for an extended period of time, we have faced competition from more established lenders, as well as some smaller lenders, in those markets. &#160; Sales and Marketing &#160; We do not engage any third parties for sales and marketing. Rather, we rely on our internal team to generate lending opportunities as well as referrals from existing or former borrowers, brokers and bankers and advertising to generate lending opportunities. A principal source of new transactions has been repeat business from prior customers and their referral of new leads. &#160; Intellectual Property &#160; Our business does not depend on exploiting or leveraging any intellectual property rights. To the extent we own any rights to intellectual property, we rely on a combination of federal, state and common law trademarks, service marks and trade names, copyrights and trade secret protection. We have registered some of our trademarks and service marks in the United States Patent and Trademark Office including &#8220;Manhattan Bridge Capital&#8221;. &#160; &#160; &#160; The protective steps we have taken may not deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. These claims, if meritorious, could require us to license other rights or subject us to damages and, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources on our part. &#160; Employees &#160; As of December 31, 2019, we employed five employees. In addition, during 2019 we used outside lawyers and other independent professionals to verify titles and ownership, to file liens and to consummate the transactions. Outside appraisers were used to assist management in evaluating the worth of collateral, when deemed necessary by management. We also used construction inspectors as well as mortgage brokers and deal initiators. &#160; Regulation &#160; Our operations are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by state and federal governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions. In addition, we may rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act and ERISA. These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third-parties who we do not control. &#160; Regulation of Commercial Real Estate Lending Activities &#160; Although most states do not regulate commercial finance, certain states impose limitations on interest rates and other charges and on certain collection practices and creditor remedies, and require licensing of lenders and financiers and adequate disclosure of certain contract terms. We also are required to comply with certain provisions of, among other statutes and regulations, certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans, The USA PATRIOT Act, regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control and federal and state securities laws and regulations. &#160; Investment Company Act Exemption &#160; Although we reserve the right to modify our business methods at any time, we are not currently required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, we cannot assure you that our business strategy will not evolve over time in a manner that could subject us to the registration requirements of the Investment Company Act. &#160; Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer&#8217;s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40% test. &#160; &#160; &#160; We rely on the exception set forth in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act which excludes from the definition of investment company &#8220;[a]ny person who is not engaged in the business of issuing redeemable securities, face-amount certificates of the installment type or periodic payment plan certificates, and who is primarily engaged in one or more of the following businesses... (C) purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.&#8221; This exception generally requires that at least 55% of an entity&#8217;s assets be comprised of mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate, also known as &#8220;qualifying interests,&#8221; and at least another 25% of the entity&#8217;s assets must be comprised of real estate-type interests reduced by any amount of qualifying interests that the entity holds in excess of the 55% minimum limit (with no more than 20% of the entity&#8217;s assets comprised of miscellaneous assets). At the present time, we qualify for the exception under this section and our current intention is to continue to focus on originating short term loans secured by first mortgages on real property. However, if, in the future, we do acquire non-real estate assets without the acquisition of substantial real estate assets, we may be deemed to be an &#8220;investment company&#8221; and be required to register as such under the Investment Company Act, which could have a material adverse effect on us. &#160; If we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, and other matters. &#160; Qualification for exclusion from the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act will limit our ability to make certain investments. In addition, complying with the tests for such exclusion could restrict the time at which we can acquire and sell assets. &#160; Environmental Laws &#160; Our borrowers, who own properties, may be subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. To the extent that an owner of a property underlying one of our debt instruments becomes liable for removal costs, the ability of the owner to make payments to us may be reduced, which in turn may adversely affect the value of the relevant mortgage asset held by us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. To date, our borrowers&#8217; compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our earnings and we do not have reason to believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on the properties owned by our borrowers. &#160; Available information &#160; We make available our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), as amended, free of charge on our website at www.manhattanbridgecapital.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Report. &#160; &#160; &#160; ","19":" ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160; &#160; Company Overview &#160; We are a leading communications software innovator that powers multimedia social applications. We have also have developed a suite of secure communications software for use worldwide. Our product portfolio includes Paltalk and Camfrog, which together host one of the world&#8217;s largest collections of video-based communities. Our other products include Tinychat and Vumber. The Company has an over 20 year history of technology innovation and holds 18 patents.&#160;We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 2005. Our principal executive office is located at 122 East 42 nd Street, Suite 3400, New York, New York 10168.&#160;Our Services and Products &#160; We operate a leading network of consumer applications that we believe create a unique social media enterprise where users can meet, see, chat, broadcast and message in real time in a secure environment with others in our network. Our consumer applications generate revenue principally from subscription fees and advertising arrangements.&#160;We believe that the scale of our subscriber base presents a competitive advantage in the video social networking industry and provides growth opportunities to advance existing products with up-sell opportunities and build future brands with cross-sell offers.&#160;We also believe that our proprietary consumer app technology platform can scalably support large communities of users in activities such as video, voice and text chat and provide robust user monetization tools. In October 2019, we commenced a strategy to make our video chat platform available to potential third-party partners with large user communities to provide retention-enhancing social and communication features while potentially providing additional commercial opportunities for those partners. We expect to participate in the commercial upside with such partners via revenue sharing arrangements that we plan to negotiate on a partner-specific basis. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we agreed to collaborate with a third party with a community of over 30 million monthly active users, which has agreed to promote a co-branded version of our Paltalk video chat program to its user base on a trial basis.&#160;Our continued growth depends on attracting new consumer application users through the introduction of new applications, features and partnerships and further penetration of our existing markets. Our principal growth strategy is to invest in the development of proprietary software, expand our sales and marketing efforts with respect to such software, and increase our consumer application user base through potential platform partnerships and new and existing advertising campaigns that we run through internet and mobile advertising networks, all while balancing the capital needs of the business. &#160; &#160; Our strategy is to approach these opportunities in a measured way, being mindful of the Company&#8217;s resources and evaluating factors such as potential revenue, time to market and amount of capital needed to invest in the opportunity.&#160;Consumer Applications &#160;We operate a leading network of consumer applications that create a unique social media enterprise where users can meet, see, chat, broadcast and message in real time in a secure environment with others in our network. The proprietary technology underlying our products allows us to operate thousands of simultaneous streams, including on mobile platforms, which support interactions on a one-on-one, one-to-many and many-to-many basis. Furthermore, our technology is supported by a portfolio of 18 issued patents.&#160;Live Video Chat . We have three existing products in the video chat space: Paltalk, Camfrog and Tinychat. The major revenue-generating live video chat products are Paltalk and Camfrog. Each product enables individuals to self-organize around topics and users with common affinities. Tinychat enables adaptations of our video technology for alternative uses and opportunities in the future.&#160;&#160; &#160;Paltalk and Camfrog are both leading providers of live video social networking applications available on Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android and other tablet devices. Together, these products power one of the world&#8217;s largest global collections of video based communities, with proprietary technology to host thousands of simultaneous live group conversations on topics such as politics, financial markets, music and dating. Our proprietary client server technology helps maintain high quality video and audio, even as many users simultaneously watch a particular broadcaster. Paltalk and Camfrog both attract a demographically and geographically diverse user base, with users in over 180 different countries. Paltalk users are approximately one-third domestic and two-thirds international, and Camfrog users have an even larger international presence, with a particular concentration in Southeast Asia.&#160;Telecommunications . We own and operate a small telecommunications services provider called Vumber that enables users to have multiple phone numbers in any area code through which calls can be forwarded to a user&#8217;s existing cell phone or land line telephone number. Vumber serves both the retail and small business community. Vumber not only allows individuals to communicate while protecting privacy, but also gives business professionals the ability to add a new business line with any chosen area code to their cell phones. Vumber provides an in-depth data analytics platform that can track, record and analyze calls to gain new insights into one&#8217;s business.&#160;Product Payment Options . Our users have a variety of methods by which to purchase product subscriptions across all of our platforms. Users can pay by credit card, PayPal, Western Union, check, local e-wallet providers, or complete an in-app purchase through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store for Android users.&#160;Apple retains 30% of the revenue that is generated from sales on our iPhone application through in-app purchases in the United States. Google also retains 30% of the revenue that is generated from sales on Android applications via Google wallet through in-app purchases in the United States.&#160;All of our credit card transactions are processed through various payment providers. Video chat users in certain international territories also have an option to purchase through local resellers. Local resellers prepay in bulk for services and debit the prepaid balance as one-time subscriptions and virtual currency are sold to end users. Regardless of which payment method is utilized, users may access our products through any of the gateways we offer. &#160; &#160;Technology Implementation Services and Secured Communications &#160;In the first quarter of 2018 we began developing and licensing our suite of secure communications software. In addition, we began providing professional services to customize and integrate our software solutions to meet client needs. On March 21, 2018, we entered into a technology services agreement with ProximaX whereby we agreed to provide certain development and related services to ProximaX to facilitate the implementation of our PeerStream Protocol (&#8220;PSP&#8221;) into their proprietary blockchain protocol.&#160;In the second quarter of 2019, the Company completed, and ProximaX accepted delivery of, the work prescribed under the agreement. During the final stages of delivery of the second project milestone set forth in the agreement, ProximaX informed the Company that capital constraints made it unable to pay the Company. Accordingly, the Company and ProximaX entered into an agreement, effective June 24, 2019, to terminate the technology services agreement and provide for payment terms for the remaining amounts due under the technology services agreement.&#160;On February 21, 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;SecureCo Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with SecureCo, LLC (&#8220;SecureCo&#8221;), whereby, subject to the terms of the Agreement, we agreed to sell substantially all of the assets related to our secure communications business, which includes communication solutions and operations capabilities with respect to the development and commercialization of secure messaging and data applications, software and middleware for enterprise and government client targets (the &#8220;Secure Communications Assets&#8221;), to SecureCo for a cash purchase price of approximately $540,000, which is comprised of a base purchase price of $500,000 plus the reimbursement or waiver of certain severance expenses payable by the Company to certain former executive officers. In addition, we would be entitled to receive a transition service fee of five percent (5%) of all revenue received by SecureCo or its Affiliates pursuant to certain unassignable contracts.&#160;The closing of the sale of the Assets is subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions by the Company and SecureCo, including, among other things, a condition that SecureCo shall have received financing that is sufficient to fund the purchase price. If the transaction is consummated, we do not expect to continue to pursue secured communications products or technology implementation services as part of our overall business strategy. If the transaction is not consummated , we expect to take a measured approach with respect to the potential commercialization of these products in a fiscally responsible manner. &#160;&#160; &#160;Company Business Strategy &#160;Enhance Existing Live Video Chat Applications &#160;We plan to enhance our existing live video chat applications, which we anticipate will include several initiatives intended to improve usage and revenue potential. We plan to add incentives for loyal or valuable users to enhance retention and overall user activity in the products. We also intend to improve our product and marketing capabilities on mobile, to enhance monetization and our ability to acquire new users on mobile platforms. In addition, we expect to increase the quality and quantity of live streaming entertainment content and broaden the distribution across our user base. Finally, we will continue to integrate certain technical functions of Paltalk and Camfrog, which will reduce operating costs and speed time-to-market of future enhancements.&#160; Launch Consumer Application Platform Strategy &#160; At the end of 2019, we launched our consumer application platform strategy, under which we plan to co-brand our video chat applications and promote them in partnership with third-party communities, with the expectation of entering into revenue sharing arrangements with potential partners. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we reached an agreement with a launch partner with 30 million monthly active users who has agreed to a trial of our consumer application platform. We plan to seek to open more of these types of partnerships in the future.&#160; Refocus Plans for Business-to-Business Solutions in Secure Communications &#160;The cybersecurity market is large and growing rapidly, and the segment that addresses secure communications has attracted interest as high profile communication hacks and data breaches gain media publicity. We believe PSP and Backchannel, our branded framework designed to be a secure video-enabled mobile messaging solution for enterprise and government end users, present a differentiated solution to this market with additional layers of security that are not commonly offered. In February 2020, we contracted to sell substantially all of the Secure Communications Assets to SecureCo. If the transaction does not close for any reason, we expect that we may take a measured approach to the marketing activities we began in 2019 and move toward commercialization of these products in a fiscally responsible manner. However, we may also seek an alternative purchaser for the Secure Communications Assets or we may determine to no longer pursue the secure communications line of business if we determine it would no longer be economically viable to do so. &#160; &#160;Defend our Intellectual Property &#160;We have a portfolio of 18 issued patents. We have successfully defended our intellectual property in the past and have generated tens of millions of dollars in licensing fees for the use of our patents. In 2016, we commenced an enforcement action related to two of our patents against Riot Games, Inc. and Valve Corporation for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,822,523 and 6,226,686 with respect to their online games League of Legends and Defense of the Ancients 2. These two patents were previously asserted against, and then licensed to, Microsoft, Sony, and Activision. In 2018, Valve Corporation moved to transfer the litigation from Delaware to the Western District of Washington. Such motion was granted by the court.&#160;Riot Games, Inc. has filed a total of four inter parts reviews at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (&#8220;PTAB&#8221;) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, two per patent held by Paltalk Holdings, Inc., seeking to have the Paltalk Holdings, Inc. patents declared invalid. On May 14, 2019, the PTAB rejected the validity of the patents. On September 27, 2019, the Company filed an appeal of the PTAB&#8217;s ruling.&#160;For additional information concerning the status of these proceedings, see &#8220;Item 3. Legal Proceedings&#8221; herein.&#160; Sale of Non-Core Assets &#160; On January 31, 2019, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with The Dating Company, LLC, pursuant to which we sold substantially all of the assets related to our online dating services business under the domain names FirstMet, 50more, and The Grade for a cash purchase price of $1.6 million, with $100.0 thousand of the purchase price that was held in an escrow account to secure certain of our post-closing indemnification obligations. The closing of the asset sale was effective as of January 31, 2019.&#160;&#160; &#160;On February 21, 2020, we entered into the SecureCo Purchase Agreement with SecureCo, whereby we agreed, subject to the terms of the Agreement, to sell substantially all of the Secure Communications Assets to SecureCo for a cash purchase price of approximately $540,000, which is comprised of a base purchase price of $500,000 plus the reimbursement or waiver of certain severance expenses payable by the Company to certain former executive officers. In addition, we would be entitled to receive a transition service fee of five percent (5%) of all revenue received by SecureCo or its Affiliates pursuant to certain unassignable contracts. If the transaction is consummated, we do not expect to continue to pursue secured communications products or technology implementation services as part of our overall business strategy.&#160;Marketing Strategy &#160;We invest in advertising and marketing primarily for the purpose of acquiring users for our consumer applications. We adapt our marketing expenditures and channels as we gather the data to analyze the success of our campaigns. We primarily advertise through internet and mobile advertising networks and run hundreds of campaigns at any given time, targeting various audiences of users, and focusing on campaigns that we believe will produce a positive return over the lifetime of new users. We also generate new sign-ups organically, as people find our sites and applications through brand recognition and word of mouth, search engines and product review websites.&#160;Competition and Our Industry &#160;Competition in the industries in which we compete remains fierce. The markets for consumer applications, secure communications software and technology implementation services are extremely dynamic and are undergoing constant change. We believe this environment creates significant opportunities for us as well as our direct and indirect competitors. Our principal competitors consist of:&#160;&#9679; Consumer Applications: YouNow, Inc. (&#8220;YouNow&#8221;), Live.me, BIGO Live, Live.ly, Houseparty, Facebook Live, YouTube Live, Instagram Live, and Twitch; &#160;&#160; &#9679; Secure Communications Software Licensing: Adeya SA, Commdex, Ercom, IVCi LLC, KoolSpan, Ribbon Communications Inc. and Wickr; and &#160;&#160; &#9679; Technology Implementation Services: IBM, Accenture, Cognizant, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, Wipro Limited, as well as Virtusa, Saksoft, Mindtree, Larsen &#38; Toubro Infotech Limited, ConsenSys, Vanbex Group and CanYa. &#160;As described above, if the sale of the Secure Communications Assets is completed, we no longer expect to compete in the secure communications software licensing or technology implementation services lines of business.&#160;Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, managerial, technological and other resources than we do. In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into the industries in which we operate, and, as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise and skilled personnel may become one of our competitors.&#160;In order to compete effectively, we seek to offer software, services and applications that are differentiated from existing products, superior in quality and more appealing than those of our competitors. We believe that our applications compete favorably against those offered by our competitors due to their ability to scale easily, their cost-efficiency and their innovative technology. We also believe that we have the tools and expertise to attract new users through Facebook and other sources at a lower cost per subscriber than certain of our traditional competitors.&#160;Although we believe we have the capability to compete effectively in our industries, our competitors may offer products, services and applications that we do not provide with more desirable features or at lower prices, and they may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. In addition, many of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have, including relationships with our potential customers.&#160;Governmental Regulations &#160;We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet, many of which are still evolving and being litigated in the courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations may involve user privacy, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal and state laws regarding privacy and protection of user data, which are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. We are also subject to diverse and evolving laws and regulations in other countries in which we operate. The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which we operate. Because our applications are accessible worldwide and used by residents of some foreign countries, foreign jurisdictions may claim that we must comply with foreign laws, even in jurisdictions in which we have no local business entity, employees or infrastructure.&#160;&#160; &#160;We are also subject to federal laws and regulations regarding content, privacy and the protection of user data, including The Communications Decency Act of 1996, as amended (&#8220;The Communications Decency Act&#8221;), The Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, as amended, The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, as amended, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing (&#8220;CAN-SPAM&#8221;) Act of 2003, among others. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act limits our liability as an online service provider for linking to or hosting third-party content that infringes copyrights. The Communications Decency Act provides statutory protections to online service providers like us who distribute third-party content. The Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act restricts the ability of online service providers to collect personal information from children under 13. Congress, the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) and many states have promulgated laws and regulations regarding email advertising, including the CAN-SPAM Act. Any changes in these laws or judicial interpretations narrowing the protections of these laws may subject us to increased risk, increased costs of compliance, and limits on the operation of certain parts of our business.&#160;Growing public concern about privacy and the use of personal information may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny. Regulation related to the provision of online services is evolving as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of data. This includes, for example, the new California Consumer Protection Act, which became effective on January 1, 2020. The FTC has, over the last few years, begun investigating companies that have used personally identifiable information in a deceptive or unfair manner or in violation of a posted privacy policy. On May 25, 2018, the European Union implemented a privacy directive called the Global Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) that imposes additional new regulatory scrutiny on our business in that geographic region with possible financial consequences for noncompliance. If we are accused of violating the terms of our privacy policy, implementing unfair privacy practices or otherwise breaching data privacy laws, we may be forced to expend significant financial and managerial resources to defend against an FTC, GDPR or other state or federal enforcement action. Our user database holds the personal information of our users and subscribers residing in the United States and other countries, and we could be sued by those users if any of the information is misappropriated. Any failure by us to adequately protect our users&#8217; privacy and data could also result in loss of user confidence in our consumer applications and services and ultimately in a loss of active subscribers, which could adversely affect our business.&#160;In addition, virtually every U.S. state has passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data resulting in unauthorized disclosure, many of which are modeled on California&#8217;s Information Practices Act. There are a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress and various state legislative bodies concerning data protection that could, if adopted, have an adverse effect on our business. We are unable to determine if and when such legislation may be adopted. Many jurisdictions, including the European Union, have adopted breach notification and other data protection notification laws designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information. The introduction of new privacy and data breach laws and the interpretation of existing privacy and data breach laws in the United States, Europe and other foreign jurisdictions is constantly evolving. There is a risk that new laws may be introduced or existing laws may be applied in a way that would conflict our current data protection practices or prevent the transfer of data between countries in which we operate.&#160;In addition, rising concern about the use of social networking technologies for illegal conduct may in the future produce legislation or other governmental action that could require changes to our applications or restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business. These regulatory and legislative developments, including excessive taxation, may prevent or significantly limit our ability to expand our business.&#160;We may also become subject to laws or regulations in the future that limit our ability to accept bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as a form of payment or to otherwise hold bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. As cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies, with certain governments deeming cryptocurrency offerings and cryptocurrency exchanges illegal, while others have allowed their use and trade. Governments may in the future curtail or outlaw the acquisition or use of cryptocurrencies or the exchange of cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies. Ownership of, holding, trading in or participating in offerings of cryptocurrencies may then be considered illegal and subject to sanction. Governments may also take regulatory action that may increase the cost and\/or subject companies that transact in or hold cryptocurrencies to additional regulation. Finally, we are party to an arrangement under which we may distribute cryptocurrency tokens to users of our applications. It is possible that the SEC or another regulator could conclude that our distribution of these tokens constitutes broker-dealer activity and could force us to register as a broker-dealer and comply with laws and regulations applicable to broker-dealers.&#160;&#160; &#160;Employees &#160;As of March 20, 2020, we had 24 employees. We believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate and retain qualified personnel.

BUSINES S Overview General. S|T|O|R|E is an internally managed net-lease real estate investment trust, or REIT, that is the leader in the acquisition, investment and management of S ingle T enant O perational R eal E state, or STORE Properties, which is our target market and the inspiration for our name. A STORE Property is a real property location at which a company operates its business and generates sales and profits, which makes the location a profit center and, therefore, fundamentally important to that business.S|T|O|R|E continues the investment activities of our senior leadership team, which has been investing in single-tenant operational real estate for over 30 years. We are one of the largest and fastest-growing net-lease REITs, and own a well-diversified portfolio that consists of investments in 2,504 property locations operated by 478 customers across 49 states as of December 31, 2019. Our customers operate across a wide variety of industries within the service, retail and manufacturing sectors of the U.S. economy, with restaurants, early childhood education centers, health clubs, furniture stores and automotive repair and maintenance services representing the top industries in our portfolio.The following table depicts the growth in our investment portfolio since our inception in 2011.Our Total Investment Portfolio at Period End &#8203; Status as a REIT. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, commencing with our initial taxable year ended December 31, 2011. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. The Net-Lease Model . S|T|O|R|E is a net-lease REIT. Accordingly, we acquire STORE Properties from business owners, and then lease the properties back to the business owners under net-leases, substantially all of which are triple-net. Under a triple-net lease, our customer (the tenant) is solely responsible for operating the business conducted at the property subject to the lease, keeping property and improvements in good order and repair, remodeling and updating the building as it deems appropriate to maximize business value, and paying the insurance, property taxes and other property-related expenses. Under the triple-net lease model, therefore, S|T|O|R|E is not a real estate operator; rather, we provide real estate financing solutions to customers seeking a long-term, lower-cost alternative to real estate ownership. Following our acquisition of a property, it is our customer, and not S|T|O|R|E , that controls the property, including with respect to decisions as to when and how to implement environmentally sustainable practices at a given property. Our Corporate Responsibility . S|T|O|R|E&#8217;s beginning was inspired by our belief that we could make a positive difference for real estate intensive businesses across the U.S. by delivering innovative and superior real estate capital solutions. That belief has guided our efforts to bring much needed capital and liquidity opportunities to middle market businesses which, in turn, have brought value creation and growth to our most integral stakeholders: our customers, stockholders and employees. While we do not control the business operations at our properties, as the property owner, we nevertheless recognize that the operation of commercial real estate assets can have a meaningful impact on the environment &#8211; particularly with respect to resource consumption and waste generation &#8211; and on the health of building occupants. We believe that being conscious of, and seeking to address, environmental impacts within our control, and supporting our customers to do the same in their businesses, plays a role in building and sustaining successful enterprises and, thus, is material to the success of our own business. In addition, we are committed to operating our business responsibly, guarding our valuable reputation and creating long-term and sustainable value for our company through a robust business model and attentiveness to our many stakeholders. S|T|O|R|E is committed to playing an important role for middle market and larger companies across the U.S. in order to help them succeed, while making a positive impact on our collective communities, both today and for future generations. 2019 Highlights &#9679; During the year ended December 31, 2019, we invested approximately $1.7 billion in 350 property locations. &#9679; As of December 31, 2019, our total gross investment in real estate had reached approximately $8.8 billion, of which $5.3 billion was unencumbered . Our long-term outstanding debt totaled $3.6 billion at December 31, 2019, and, at that date, a pproximately $2.4 billion of our total long-term debt was secured debt and approximately $3.5 billion of our investment portfolio served as collateral for these outstanding borrowings. &#9679; For the year ended December 31, 2019, we declared dividends totaling $1.36 per share of common stock to our stockholders. In the third quarter of 2019, we raised our quarterly dividend 6.1% from our previous quarterly dividend amount. &#9679; During 2019, we raised aggregate net proceeds of $650.5 million from sales of shares under our &#8220;at the market&#8221;, or ATM, equity offering program. As of December 31, 2019, we had the ability to offer and sell up to an additional $700.0 million of our shares of common stock under our $900.0 million ATM authorization established in November 2019. &#9679; In February 2019, we completed our second public debt offering, issuing $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured, investment-grade rated 4.625% Senior Notes, due in March 2029. &#9679; In November 2019, we marked our ninth issuance of net-lease mortgage notes under our STORE Master Funding debt program; we issued a total o f $508.0 million of net-lease mortgage notes, of which $326.0 million are rated AAA with the remainder rated A+. Of the $508.0 million issued, $380.0 million has a 15-year term. The weighted average coupon rate of the AAA rated notes is 3.44% and the weighted average coupon rate of the A+ rated notes is 4.19%. &#9679; In the fourth quarter of 2019, in conjunction with the $508.0 million STORE Master Funding debt issuance, we prepaid, without penalty, STORE Master Funding notes with an aggregate balance of approximately $186.1 million at the time of prepayment; these notes were scheduled to mature in 2020 or 2021 and bore a weighted average coupon rate of 4.22%. Our Target Market We are the leader in providing real estate financing solutions principally to middle-market and larger businesses that own STORE Properties and operate within the broad-based service, retail and manufacturing sectors of the U.S. economy. We have designed our net-lease solutions to provide a long-term, lower-cost way to improve our customers&#8217; capital structures and, thus, be a preferred alternative to real estate ownership. We estimate the market for STORE Properties to exceed $3.4 trillion in market value and to include more than 2.0 million properties.We define middle-market companies as those having approximate annual gross revenues of between $10 million and $1.0 billion, although approximately 20% of our customers have annual revenues in excess of $1.0 billion. The median annual revenues of our 478 customers was approximately $55 million and, on a weighted average basis, our average customer has revenues of approximately $853 million. Most of our customers do not have credit ratings, while some have ratings from rating agencies that service insurance companies or fixed-income investors. Most of these non-rated companies either prefer to be unrated or are simply too small to issue debt rated by a nationally recognized rating agency in a cost-efficient manner.The financing marketplace for STORE Properties is highly fragmented, with few participants addressing the long-term capital needs of middle-market and larger non-rated companies. While we believe our net-lease financing solutions can add value to a wide variety of companies, we believe the largest underserved market and, therefore, our greatest opportunity is non-rated, bank-dependent, middle-market and larger companies that generally have less access to efficient sources of long-term capital.Our customers typically have the choice either to own or to lease the real estate they use in their daily businesses. They choose to lease for various reasons, including the potential to lower their cost of capital, as leasing supplants traditional financing options that tie up equity in the real estate. Leasing is also viewed as an attractive alternative to our customers because it generally locks in scheduled payments, at lower levels and for longer periods, than traditional financing options; these factors are viewed favorably relative to the amounts funded.Whether companies elect to rent or own the real estate they use in their businesses is most often a financial decision. For the few highly capitalized large companies that possess investment-grade credit ratings, real estate leasing tends to be viewed as a substitute for corporate borrowings that they could otherwise access (so long as they remain highly rated and equitized). With real estate leases often bearing rental costs that exceed corporate term borrowing costs, such companies elect to rent for strategic reasons. Such reasons may include the long-term flexibility to vacate properties that are no longer strategic, the permanence of lease capital which lessens potential refinancing risk should corporate credit ratings deteriorate, the lack of corporate financial covenants associated with leasing and the ability to harness developers to effectively outsource their real estate development needs. The primary motivations for S|T|O|R|E&#8217;s middle market and larger customers tend to be different. For such companies, real estate leasing solutions offer the potential to lower their cost of capital. In addition to these primary economic motivations, real estate leasing offers the potential for greater corporate flexibility, which is a hallmark of S|T|O|R|E&#8217;s approach and which offers the potential for further tenant wealth creation. Important tenant concerns include lease assignability, property substitution rights, property closure rights and the ability of S|T|O|R|E to assist with property expansion and lease contract modification. We believe that our customers select us as their landlord of choice principally as a result of our service, comparative business flexibility and the tailored net-lease solutions we provide. We believe the demand for our net-lease solutions has grown as a result of the current bank regulatory environment. In our view, the increased scrutiny and regulation of the banking industry in response to the collapse of the housing and mortgage industries from 2007 to 2009, particularly with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, and the Basel Accords issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, have constrained real estate lending practices and limited desirable term debt real estate borrowing options. Real estate leasing today represents a highly desirable component of corporate capitalization strategies due, in part, to the unavailability of long-term, fixed rate commercial real estate mortgage financing with important features such as affordable prepayment and modification options or loan assignability. S|T|O|R|E was formed to capitalize on a large market opportunity resulting from the widespread need amongst middle market and larger companies for efficient corporate real estate capital solutions. We believe our opportunities include both gaining market share from the fragmented network of net-lease capital providers and growing the market by creating demand for our net-lease solutions that meet the long-term real estate capital needs of these companies. The estimated $3.4 trillion market of STORE Properties is divided into three primary industry sectors and various industry sub-sectors. The primary sectors and their proportion of this $3.4 trillion market of STORE Properties are service at 42%, retail at 46% and manufacturing at 12%. The sub-sectors included within each primary sector are summarized in the table below.Service&#8203; Retail&#8203; ManufacturingRestaurants&#8203; Big box retail&#8203; Industrial profit-centersEducation&#8203; Specialty retail&#8203; Light manufacturingFitness centers&#8203; Grocery&#8203; &#8203; Transportation&#8203; Drug stores&#8203; &#8203; Automotive services&#8203; Automotive (new and used)&#8203; &#8203; Family entertainment&#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Within the sub-sectors, the market for STORE Properties is further subdivided into a wide variety of industries within the service, retail and manufacturing sectors, such as:Automotive parts stores&#8203; Movie theatersCold storage facilities&#8203; Office supplies retailersDepartment stores&#8203; Pet care facilitiesDiscount stores&#8203; Rental centersEarly childhood education&#8203; Secondary educationFamily entertainment facilities&#8203; SupermarketsFast food restaurants&#8203; Truck stopsFull service restaurants&#8203; Wholesale clubsFurniture stores&#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Although many of these industries are represented within our diverse property portfolio, S|T|O|R|E primarily targets service sector properties that represent a broad array of everyday services (such as restaurants and health clubs) , are located near customers targeted by the business operating on the property and are for services not readily available online. Although not our primary focus, the retail sector assets we target are primarily located in retail corridors, tend to be internet resistant and include a high experiential component, such as furniture and hunting and fishing stores. In the manufacturing sector we typically target properties across a broad array of industries that are located in industrial parks near customers and suppliers, and that are operated by businesses that produce everyday necessities. As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio of investments in STORE Properties was diversified across more than 100 industries, of which 65% was in the service sector, 19% was in the retail sector and 16% was in the manufacturing sector, based on annualized revenue.Our Asset Class: STORE Properties STORE Properties are a unique asset class that inspired the formation of S|T|O|R|E and our company name. STORE (Single Tenant Operational Real Estate) Properties are profit-center real estate locations on which our customers conduct their businesses and generate revenues and profits. The defining characteristic of STORE Properties is the number of payment sources: STORE Properties have the following three payment sources, whereas all other commercial real estate assets have just two.&#9679; Unit-Level Profitability . STORE Properties are distinguished by the primary source of their rent payment, which comes directly from the profits produced by the business operations at the real estate locations we own, which we refer to as unit-level profitability. While it is a common perception that the tenant under a lease is the primary source of the rent payment (as distinguished from the business unit operating at the leased site), we have observed a historic pattern in which tenants in corporate insolvencies seek to vacate unprofitable locations while retaining profitable ones, which indicates that the profitability of the location is the main indicator of a tenant&#8217;s long-term ability to pay. Because insolvent tenants historically retain profitable locations while seeking to vacate unprofitable ones, it is fundamentally important for S|T|O|R|E to collect and review the unit-level financial statements of the businesses our customers operate at our real estate locations, which is a key component of our business model. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 98% of the properties in our portfolio are subject to unit-level financial reporting requirements. Without access to unit-level financial reporting for the business activities conducted on the properties we own, it is difficult to accurately assess our customer&#8217;s business and, thus, the quality of the most important, and primary, source for our rent payments. &#9679; Customer Credit Quality . In addition to the unit-level profitability of the business on the real estate we own, our customers&#8217; overall financial health, or credit quality, serves as a secondary source of payment. Our customer&#8217;s credit can become the primary payment source if our unit is not profitable and our customer is required to divert cash flows from its other profitable locations or utilize other resources to pay our rents. However, we have seen that customer credit quality tends to be subject to greater volatility over time than unit-level profitability, because customer credit quality is not only a function of the unit-level profitability of the operations at our locations, but of the profitability of potentially many other existing and new assets owned and operated by our customer. Corporate financial health is also a function of many other decisions, such as optional changes in capital structure or growth strategies, as well as conditions in the marketplace for our customers&#8217; products and services, that can change over time and that may have profound impacts on customer creditworthiness. &#9679; Real Estate Residual Value . The final payment source that is common to all real estate investments is the residual value of the underlying real estate, which gives us the opportunity to receive rents from substitute tenants in the event our property becomes vacant. For S|T|O|R|E, this means more than just looking at comparable lease rates and transactions. Studies we have completed underscore the importance of investing in properties at or below their as-new replacement costs. We also review the local markets in which our properties are located and seek to have rents that are at or below prevailing market rents on a per square foot basis for comparable properties. Taking these steps protects S|T|O|R|E and our customers by making it easier for us to assign, sell or sublease properties that our customers may want to sell, reposition or vacate as part of their capital efficiency strategies. Creating Investment-Grade Contracts From our inception in 2011, based upon the experiences gained by our founding leadership team over more than 30 years and two prior successful public companies, we have emphasized and uniquely disclosed information regarding the net-lease contracts we create with our tenants. We believe that our net-lease contracts, and not simply tenant or real estate quality, are central to our potential to deliver superior long-term risk-adjusted rates of return to our stockholders. Contract quality embodies tenant and real estate characteristics, together with other investment attributes we believe are highly material. Contract attributes include the prices we pay for the real estate we own, inclusive of the prices relative to new construction cost. As of December 31, 2019, our average investment approximated 81% of replacement cost, a statistic that has been relatively stable since 2015. Other important contract attributes include the ability to receive unit-level financial statements, which allows us to evaluate unit-level cash flows relative to the rents we receive. As of December 31, 2019, the median ability of the properties we own to cover our rents, inclusive of an allowance for indirect costs, approximated 2.2:1, which has also held fairly stable since 2015. Likewise, over many years of providing real estate net-lease capital, we have determined that tenant alignments of interest are highly important. Such alignments of interest can include full parent company recourse, credit enhancements in the form of guarantees, cross default provisions and the use of master leases. Master leases are individual lease contracts that bind multiple properties and offer landlords greater security in the event of tenant insolvency and bankruptcy. Whereas individual property leases provide tenants with the opportunity to evaluate the desirability and viability of each individual property they rent in the event of a bankruptcy, master leases bind multiple properties, permitting landlords to benefit from aggregate property performance and limiting tenants&#8217; ability to pick and choose which leases to retain. As of December 31, 2019, 92% of our multi-property net-lease contracts were in the form of master leases. Contract economic terms are also highly important because they can enhance margins of safety. During 2019, our weighted average initial lease rate was 7.8%, with annual contractual lease escalations averaging an added 1.9% of contract rents. We believe that our initial yields, on average, range from 10% to 15% above those expected by investors seeking real estate investment opportunities through the broker auction market, which provides us greater flexibility to preserve and enhance returns. Other important tenant contract considerations include indemnification provisions, lease renewal rights, and the ability to sublease and assign leases, as well as qualitative considerations, such as alternative real estate use assessment and the composition of a tenant&#8217;s capitalization structure. Since our November 2014 initial public offering, S|T|O|R|E&#8217;s extensive contract attribute disclosure has uniquely included a tenant credit quality distribution chart, employing computed implied credit ratings applied to regularly received tenant financial statements using Moody&#8217;s Analytics RiskCalc. Since tenant credit ratings are merely one component of contract risk, we developed a means to deliver a base quantitative contract quality estimate. Our approach was to modify risk of tenant insolvency, as estimated by the Moody&#8217;s algorithm, by our own estimate of the likelihood of property closure, based on the regularly monitored profitability of the properties bound by each lease contract we create. To accomplish this, we established a simple range of property closure likelihood ranging from 10% to 100% based upon property profitability ranges from breakeven to a computed ability to cover our rents twice over. Multiplying tenant estimated insolvency probability (Moody&#8217;s Analytics RiskCalc) by our estimate of the probability of property closure results in a contract risk measurement that we call the STORE Score and which we regularly and uniquely disclose.Our Competitive Strengths We have a market-leading platform for the acquisition, investment in and management of STORE Properties that simultaneously creates value for stockholders and customers through our five corporate competencies. &#9679; Investment Origination . S|T|O|R|E was formed to fill a need for efficient long-term real estate capital for middle-market and larger customers. We do this principally through a solutions-oriented approach that includes the use of lease contracts that address our customers&#8217; needs and that strive to provide superior value for our customers over other financial options they may have to capitalize their businesses. A S|T|O|R|E hallmark is our ability to directly market our real estate lease solutions to middle market and larger companies nation-wide, harnessing a geographically focused team of experienced relationship managers at our home office. Approximately 80% of our investments, by dollar volume, have been originated by our internal origination team through direct new customer solicitations and a strong level of repeat business from existing customers. By creating demand for our services, we maintain a large pipeline of investment opportunities, which we estimate to be $12.1 billion as of December 31, 2019 . Our objective is to be both highly selective and achieve higher rates of return than our stockholders could achieve if they sought to acquire profit-center real estate on their own. &#9679; Investment Underwriting . Our senior leadership team has developed our methods of risk evaluation over more than 30 years and across investments of more than $19.0 billion in approximately 10,000 STORE Properties. Our investment underwriting approach centers on evaluations of unit-level and corporate-level financial performance, together with detailed real estate valuation assessments, which is reflective of the characteristics of the STORE Property asset class. We have combined our underwriting approach with our portfolio management systems to capture and track computed customer credit ratings as well as the performance of the businesses conducted at the properties we own (unit-level performance). Our focus on STORE Properties, which are profit-centers for our tenants, enables us to create lease contracts having payment performance characteristics that are generally materially superior to the implied credit ratings of our diverse tenant base. Through our underwriting and portfolio management approach, we track, measure and report investment performance, with the investment underwriting goal to create a diverse portfolio centered on investment-grade quality contracts. As of December 31, 2019, we estimate that the net portfolio losses we have experienced due to credit events experienced by our customers have averaged 0.2% per year of the total investments we have made since we began in 2011 based on average annual credit events of 1.0% and average annual net credit losses of 0.3% offset by average annual gains on property sales of 0.1%, which is reflective of our underwriting and portfolio management guidelines. &#9679; Investment Documentation . Because we believe purchase and lease contracts are the principal determinants of investment risk, we have always emphasized the importance of our investment documentation. The purchase documentation process includes the validation of investment underwriting through our due diligence process, which includes our initiation and receipt of third-party real estate valuations, title insurance, property condition assessments and environmental reports . When we are satisfied with the results and outcome of our pre-acquisition due diligence process, we enter into a lease with the seller . Our lease documents incorporate lessons learned over decades to forge balanced contracts characterized by important alignments of interest, including strong enforcement provisions. Altogether, our documentation process, like our approach to investment underwriting, is integral to investment quality and designed to offer our investors a value that most could not create for themselves. &#9679; Portfolio Management . Net-lease real estate investment portfolios require active management to realize superior risk-adjusted rates of return. S|T|O|R|E represents our senior leadership team&#8217;s third, and most highly developed and scalable, servicing platform. We are virtually paperless and can access detailed information on our large diversified portfolio from practically anywhere and at any time. For over 30 years, our senior leadership team has learned how to monitor unit-level profit and loss statements, customer corporate financial statements and the timely payment of property taxes and insurance in order to gauge portfolio quality. Having such systems is central to our ability to effectively monitor and reduce customer credit risk at the property level, which, in turn, allows us to place greater focus on effectively managing the minority of investments that may have higher risks. We believe these systems, when combined with our high degree of financial and operating flexibility, allow us to realize better stockholder risk-adjusted rates of return on our invested capital. &#9679; Financial Reporting and Treasury . We consider and evaluate our corporate financing strategies with the same emphasis as our real estate investment strategies. Under our financing strategy, borrowings must: prudently improve stockholder returns; be structured to provide portfolio flexibility and minimize our exposure to changes in long-term interest rates; be structured to optimize our cost of financing in a way that will enhance investor rates of return; and contribute to corporate governance by enhancing corporate flexibility. Our senior leadership team has extensive experience with diverse liability strategies. Today, we are one of the few REITs able to employ our own AAA rated borrowing source, while simultaneously maintaining investment-grade corporate credit ratings. We have designed and implemented strategies that add value to our investors by offering a more efficient means to finance real estate than they could otherwise do on their own. At the same time, the flexibility we derive from our liability strategies can also result in important flexibility for our customers. Our Business and Growth Strategies Our objective is to continue to create stockholder value through sustained investment and management activities designed to increase distributable cash flows and deliver attractive risk-adjusted rates of return from a growing, diverse portfolio of STORE Properties. To accomplish this, our principal business and growth strategies are as follows: &#9679; Focus on Middle-Market and Larger Companies Operating STORE Properties. We believe we have selected the most attractive investment opportunity within the net-lease market, STORE Properties, and targeted the most attractive customer type within that market, middle-market and larger non-investment-grade-rated companies. We focus on this market given its strong fundamentals and the limited long-term financing solutions available to the companies in it. Within the net-lease market for STORE Properties, our value proposition is most compelling to middle-market and larger, bank-dependent companies, most of which are not rated by any nationally recognized rating agency due to their size or capital markets preferences, but who have strong credit metrics and operate within broad-based industries having the potential for sustained relevance. &#9679; Realize Stable Income and Internal Growth. We seek to make investments that generate strong and stable current income as a result of the difference, or spread, between the rate we earn on our assets (primarily our lease revenues) and the rate we pay on our liabilities (primarily our long-term debt). We augment that income with internal growth. We seek to realize superior internal growth through a combination of (1) a target dividend payout ratio that permits a meaningful level of free cash flow reinvestment and (2) cash generated from the estimated 1.8% weighted average annual escalation of base rent and interest in our portfolio (as of December 31, 2019, as if the escalations in all of our leases were expressed on an annual basis). We benefit from contractual rent escalations, as approximately 99% of our leases and loans (as of December 31, 2019, by annualized base rent and interest) have escalations that are either fixed (14% of our leases and loans) or based on the Consumer Price Index, or CPI (85% of our leases and loans). A final means of internal growth is the accretive redeployment of cash realized from the occasional sale of real estate. During 2019, we divested $428.9 million of real estate at a net gain of $18.8 million over our initial cost which we were able to redeploy. We believe these three means of internal growth will enable strong cash flow growth without relying exclusively on future common stock issuances to fund new portfolio investments. &#9679; Capitalize on Direct Origination Capabilities for External Growth. As the market leader in STORE Property investment originations, we plan to complement our internal growth with external growth driven by continued new investments funded through future equity issuances and borrowings to expand our platform and raise investor cash flows. &#9679; Actively Manage our Balance Sheet to Maximize Capital Efficiency. We seek funding sources that enable us to lock in long-term investment spreads and limit interest rate sensitivity. We also seek to maintain a prudent balance between the use of debt (which includes our own STORE Master Funding program, unsecured term notes, commercial mortgage-backed securities borrowings, insurance borrowings, bank borrowings and possibly preferred stock issuances) and equity financing. During 2017, we received a rating of Baa2, stable outlook, from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and received a credit rating upgrade to BBB, stable outlook, from both S&#38;P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings. As of December 31, 2019, our secured and unsecured long-term debt had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $3.6 billion, a weighted average maturity of approximately seven years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.3%. &#9679; Increase our portfolio diversity. As of December 31, 2019, we had invested approximately $8.8 billion in 2,504 property locations, substantially all of which are profit centers for our customers. Our portfolio is highly diversified; built on an average transaction size of just over $9.0 million, we now have over 475 customers (having added an average of approximately 14 net new customers quarterly since inception) operating across more than 700 different brand names, or business concepts, across 49 states and over 100 industry groups. Our largest customer represented 2.8% of our portfolio as of December 31, 2019, based on annualized base rent and interest. Our portfolio&#8217;s diversity decreases the impact on us of an adverse event affecting a specific customer, industry or region, thereby increasing the stability of our cash flows. We expect that additional acquisitions in the future will further increase the diversity of our portfolio and, from time to time, we may sell properties in our portfolio to improve overall portfolio credit quality or diversity. &#9679; Engage with our tenants. In 2019, we initiated a tenant outreach program designed to gauge our tenants&#8217; current sustainability practices, provide them with sustainability education and support resources, and encourage them to engage in sustainable practices, including reducing power usage, saving water, assessing building equipment, and implementing other energy-efficiency upgrades. We believe that effective encouragement of sustainability initiatives, particularly related to energy, water and indoor environmental quality, can lead to the adoption of practices that can drive business and real estate value appreciation, decrease operating costs and mitigate regulatory risks. Environmental Risk Management We are committed to environmental sustainability and the mitigation of environmental risks in connection with the development of our property portfolio. This commitment reflects the fact that the properties we acquire are subject to both state and federal environmental regulations, but, more importantly, it aligns with our belief that being conscious of, and seeking to address and manage environmental risks within our control, and supporting our customers to do the same in their businesses, plays a role in building and sustaining successful enterprises; and, thus, is material to the success of our own business. &#8203; Our commitment to environmental sustainability begins before we acquire a real estate asset and is evident through each stage of the acquisition process.&#9679; W hen assessing a target company, we engage a nationally recognized and insured environmental engineer to perform a Phase I environmental site assessment against current industry standards and evaluate any recognized environmental conditions (RECs) identified in the assessment. We also conduct a separate, property-level sustainability assessment through an independent third party. &#9679; W hen we identify a REC, we take appropriate mitigating action, which may include conducting a Phase II environmental assessment , submitting the property into a voluntary clean-up program, purchasing an environmental insurance policy, and remediating the REC in accordance with regulatory requirements, &#9679; W hen we are satisfied with the results and outcome of our pre-acquisition due diligence process, we enter into a lease with the seller pursuant to which the seller agrees to certain covenants and indemnities that typically require the seller to comply with applicable environmental laws and remediate or take other corrective action should any environmental issues arise. We may take additional actions in situations where a target property may be subject to risks associated with climate change, particularly as a result of being located in a geographic area susceptible to floods, hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes or other climate-related occurrences. These additional steps and actions may include: maintaining comprehensive environmental insurance coverage for specified properties in our portfolio to ensure that there are financial resources available to conduct safe and timely remediation in the event of an unforeseen environmental issue; and preparing for climate-related natural disasters by requiring our tenants to carry insurance, including fire, wind\/hail, earthquake, flood and other extended coverage where appropriate given the relative risk of loss, geographic location and industry best practices.Competition We face competition in the acquisition and financing of STORE Properties from numerous investors, including, but not limited to, traded and non-traded public REITs, private equity investors and other institutional investment funds, as well as private wealth management advisory firms that serve high net worth investors (also known as family offices), some of which have greater financial resources than we do, a greater ability to borrow funds to acquire properties and the willingness to accept more risk. We also believe that competition for real estate financing comes from middle-market business owners themselves, many of whom maintain a preference to own, rather than lease, the real estate they use in their businesses. The competition we face may increase the demand for STORE Properties and, therefore, reduce the number of suitable acquisition opportunities available to us or increase the price we must pay to acquire STORE Properties. This competition will increase if investments in real estate become more attractive relative to other forms of investment.Human Capital We believe that to continue to deliver strong financial results, we must provide and maintain a work environment that: attracts, develops, and retains top talent; affords our employees an engaging work experience that allows for career development and opportunities for meaningful civic involvement; and enables every employee at every level to be treated with dignity and respect, to be free from discrimination and harassment, and to devote their full attention and best efforts to performing their job to the best of their respective abilities. We have adopted a companywide Policy Statement on Human Rights that underscores our commitment to these principles. As part of our commitment:&#9679; We seek to foster a diverse and vibrant workplace of individuals who possess a broad range of experiences, backgrounds and skills , starting at the top. At the executive level, three of our nine directors, two of our five executive officers, and eight of our fourteen officers at the level of senior vice president and above are women, and overall , we have a deep bench of men and women who are collectively fully capable of professionally operating the business and fulfilling the S|T|O|R|E vision. &#9679; W e empower our employees through employee-run engagement committees that develop and influence new employee onboarding, personal growth and professional development programs, company social and team-building events, and health and wellness programs. &#9679; W e actively support charitable organizations that promote education and social well-being and we encourage our employees to personally volunteer with organizations that are meaningful to them. For example, we proudly sponsor local charities such as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and our employees volunteer in local charitable organizations such as Arizona Helping Hands and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. As of December 31, 2019, we had 97 full-time employees, an increase of 7.8% over the total at December 31, 2018, all of whom are located in our single office in Scottsdale, Arizona. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good. Insurance Our leases and loan agreements typically require our customers to maintain insurance of the types and in the amounts that are usual and customary for similar commercial properties, including commercial general liability, fire and extended loss insurance provided by reputable companies, with commercially reasonable exclusions, deductibles and limits, all as verified by our independent insurance consultant. Separately, we purchase contingent liability insurance, in excess of our customers&#8217; liability coverage, to provide us with additional security in the event of a catastrophic claim.Regulations and Requirements Our properties are subject to various laws and regulations, including regulations relating to fire and safety requirements, as well as affirmative and negative contractual covenants and , in some instances, common area obligations. Our customers have primary responsibility for complying with these regulations and other requirements pursuant to our lease and loan agreements. We believe that each of our customers has the necessary permits and approvals to operate and conduct their businesses on our properties.About Us &#38; Available Information We were incorporated under the laws of Maryland on May 17, 2011.

Business and PropertiesCertain terms are defined in the &#8220;Glossary of Terms&#8221; beginning on page ii.Description of OperationsGulf Island Fabrication, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, &#8220;Gulf Island,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221;) is a leading fabricator of complex steel structures, modules and marine vessels, and a provider of project management, hookup, commissioning, repair, maintenance and civil construction services. Our customers include U.S. and, to a lesser extent, international energy producers&#59; refining, petrochemical, LNG, industrial, power and marine operators&#59; EPC companies&#59; and certain agencies of the U.S. government. During 2019, we operated and managed our business through three operating divisions (&#8220;Fabrication,&#8221; &#8220;Shipyard&#8221; and &#8220;Services&#8221;) and one non-operating division (&#8220;Corporate&#8221;), which represented our reportable segments. In the first quarter 2020, our Fabrication and Services Divisions were operationally combined to form an integrated new division called Fabrication &#38; Services. As a result, we operate and manage our business through two operating divisions (&#8220;Shipyard&#8221; and &#8220;Fabrication &#38; Services&#8221;) and one non-operating division (&#8220;Corporate&#8221;), which represent our reportable segments. Accordingly, the segment results (including the effects of eliminations) for our Fabrication and Services Divisions for each of 2019 and 2018 were combined to conform to the presentation of our reportable segments for 2020. In addition to the division combination, in the first quarter 2020, management and project execution responsibility for our two forty-vehicle ferry projects were transferred from our former Fabrication Division to our Shipyard Division. Accordingly, results for these projects for 2019 (the projects had no results for 2018) were reclassified from our former Fabrication Division to our Shipyard Division to conform to the presentation of these projects for 2020. See Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements (&#8220; Financial Statements&#8221;) in Item 8 for further discussion of our realigned operating divisions.Our corporate headquarters is located in Houston, Texas and our operating facilities are located in Houma, Louisiana. In the fourth quarter 2020, we closed our Jennings Yard and Lake Charles Yard within our Shipyard Division. See &#8220;Overview&#8221; section in Item 7 for discussion of our current business and outlook and Note 4 of our Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of our closure of the Jennings Yard and Lake Charles Yard.Shipyard Division &#8211; Our Shipyard Division fabricates newbuild marine vessels, including OSVs, MPSVs, research vessels, tugboats, salvage vessels, towboats, barges, drydocks, anchor handling vessels and lift boats&#59; provides marine repair and maintenance services, including steel repair, blasting and painting services, electrical systems repair, machinery and piping system repairs, and propeller, shaft, and rudder reconditioning&#59; and performs conversion projects to lengthen vessels and modify vessels to permit their use for a different type of activity or enhance their capacity or functionality. Fabrication &#38; Services Division &#8211; Our Fabrication &#38; Services (&#8220;F&#38;S&#8221;) Division fabricates modules, skids and piping systems for onshore refining, petrochemical, LNG and industrial facilities and offshore facilities&#59; fabricates foundations, secondary steel components and support structures for alternative energy developments and coastal mooring facilities&#59; fabricates offshore production platforms and associated structures, including jacket foundations, piles and topsides for fixed production and utility platforms, as well as hulls and topsides for floating production and utility platforms&#59; fabricates other complex steel structures and components&#59; provides services on offshore platforms, including welding, interconnect piping and other services required to connect production equipment and service modules and equipment&#59; provides construction and maintenance services on inland platforms and structures and at industrial facilities&#59; and performs municipal and drainage projects, including pump stations, levee reinforcement, bulkheads and other public works. Corporate Division &#8211; Our Corporate Division includes costs that do not directly relate to our two operating divisions. Such costs include, but are not limited to, costs of maintaining our corporate office, executive management salaries and incentives, board of directors&#8217; fees, litigation related costs, and costs associated with overall corporate governance and being a publicly traded company. Costs incurred by our Corporate Division on behalf of our operating divisions are allocated to the operating divisions. Such costs include, but are not limited to, human resources, insurance, information technology and accounting. Facilities and EquipmentOur Shipyard Division and Fabrication &#38; Services Division operate from our owned facilities in Houma, Louisiana (&#8220;Houma Yards&#8221;), approximately 30 miles from the Gulf of Mexico. During the fourth quarter 2020, we closed our Jennings Yard and Lake Charles Yard. Shipyard Division &#8211; Our Shipyard Division facility is located on 437 acres on the west bank of the Houma Navigation Canal, of which 283 acres is unimproved land that is available for expansion. The facility includes 18,000 square feet of administrative and operations facilities, 160,000 square feet of covered fabrication facilities and 20,000 square feet of warehouse facilities. It also has 6,750 linear feet of water frontage, including 2,350 feet of steel bulkheads. &#160;Fabrication &#38; Services Division &#8211; Our Fabrication &#38; Services Division facility is located on 226 acres on the east bank of the Houma Navigation Canal and on a slip adjacent to the Houma Navigation Canal. Th e facility includes 102,000 square feet of administrative and operations facilities, 341,000 square feet of covered fabrication facilities, 103,000 square feet of warehouse facilities, and a 13,000 square foot blasting and coating facility. It also has 5,970 linear feet of water frontage, including 2,535 feet of steel bulkheads. Facilities and Equipment &#8211; Facilities and equipment that are significant to our Houma Yards include: &#160;&#8226; Large assembly buildings equipped with overhead cranes for modular section fabrication and various equipment for pipe fitting and welding&#59; &#160;&#8226; Prefabrication shops equipped with overhead cranes, press brake for forming plate, cutting tables, coping machines, sub-arc welding stations, hydraulic iron workers, and various other equipment for fabricating steel structures and components&#59; &#160;&#8226; Alloy and carbon steel pipe fabrication and spooling shops equipped with overhead cranes, pipe benders, pipe cutters, pipe spooling and welding stations, and various equipment for pipe fitting and welding&#59; &#160;&#8226; Plate bending, rolling and assembly shop with the capability to roll steel and automatic weld process seams into tubular pipe sections&#59; &#160;&#8226; Automated panel line shop equipped with overhead cranes, cutting table, one-sided plate welder with magnetic holding system, panel marking station, stiffener fitting and welding stations, and various equipment for fitting and welding&#59; &#160;&#8226; Blast and coating shops that enable under roof blast and paint services&#59; &#160;&#8226; Large warehouse buildings for storage&#59; &#160;&#8226; Over 20 crawler cranes and 18 rubber-tired hydraulic modular transporters&#59; &#160;&#8226; A 400&#8217; x 160&#8217; floating drydock with a 15,000-ton lift capacity used for repair and conversion of vessels&#59; &#160;&#8226; A 200&#8217; x 96&#8217; floating drydock with a 4,000-ton lift capacity used for repair and conversion of vessels&#59; &#160;&#8226; Deck barge for transporting equipment and fabricated products&#59; &#160;&#8226; Truckable tug and spud barges with cranage for marine construction activities&#59; and &#160;&#8226; Various civil construction equipment. Materials and SuppliesThe principal materials and supplies used in our operations across all our divisions include standard steel shapes, steel plate, steel pipe, welding gases, welding wire, fuel, oil, and paint, all of which are currently available from many sources. We do not depend upon any single supplier or source for our materials and supplies. We anticipate being able to obtain these materials for the foreseeable future&#59; however, the pricing, availability and schedules offered by our suppliers may vary significantly from year to year due to various factors, including supplier consolidations, supplier raw material shortages, costs and surcharges, supplier capacity, customer demand, market conditions, and any duties and tariffs imposed on the materials or other import restrictions.The majority of the steel used in our operations arrives at our facilities as steel plate, which is cut and rolled into the form needed or into tubular sections at our rolling mill. Tubular sections can be welded together in long straight tubes to become legs or into shorter tubes to become part of a network of bracing. Various cuts and welds in the fabrication process are performed by computer-controlled equipment. We procure steel from both domestic and foreign mills. Delivery from domestic steel mills can take weeks or months for as-rolled steel and longer for heat treated steel. Delivery from foreign steel mills, including transit time, can take several months. Additionally, the U.S. sometimes imposes tariffs on certain imported steel which can result in higher cost for foreign steel. To mitigate the risk of increasing cost of materials during the life of a contract, we often negotiate escalation clauses in our customer contracts for steel pricing adjustments tied to changes in relevant indexes.In addition to the materials and supplies described above used in our fabrication process, we also use third-party manufacturers for engineered and manufactured equipment added to the structures, modules and vessels that we fabricate. Such manufactured equipment includes, but is not limited to valves, fittings, propulsion systems such as engines, cranes, pumps, electrical and communications systems and other technologically advanced equipment. To mitigate our risk of increasing costs, we often negotiate and purchase such equipment from the manufacturer at a fixed price. Additionally, we may use subcontractors when their use enables us to meet customer requirements for resources, schedule, cost or technical expertise. Subcontractors may range from small local entities to companies with global capabilities, some of which may be utilized on a repetitive or preferred basis. The pricing of materials and supplies and the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet delivery schedules have been impacted by the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) and may continue to be impacted by COVID-19 in the future. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A for further discussion of our use of raw materials and supplies and the impact of COVID-19 on our operations.&#160;Human Capital Management Our employees are our most important assets and serve as the foundation for our ability to achieve our financial and strategic objectives.Employee Statistics &#8211; Our workforce varies based on our level of activity at any particular time. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had 875 and 944 employees, respectively, of which approximately 10 were part-time employees. In addition, we use independent contractors as necessary to supplement our workforce. None of our employees are employed pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. Labor hours worked during 2020, 2019 and 2018, were 1.9 million, 2.4 million, and 1.9 million, respectively. Recruitment, Training and Workforce Development &#8211; Our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain a highly-skilled workforce that includes craft labor as well as supervision and various other salaried positions, including engineering, construction and project management, and project controls. Specifically, during 2020, we began increasing our skilled workforce within our Shipyard Division to execute the division&#8217;s backlog. To support the development of our workforce, we offer supervision and other training programs to educate and elevate the skillsets of our front-line leaders. We also provide internal training programs for technical fitting and welding instruction to further develop our workforce and maintain high standards of quality. We have also created a succession plan for senior leadership positions. Employee Engagement &#8211; During 2020, we launched an employee satisfaction survey to gather information from our employees regarding their perspectives on working at the Company and suggestions for improvements. We gathered valuable insights and feedback and were able to implement positive changes within our organization. Employee Benefits &#8211; Our compensation programs are designed to enable us to attract, motivate and retain our employees to achieve our objectives. We provide competitive base wages and salaries that are consistent with employee positions, skills and experience levels, and our geographic location. Employees are eligible to receive paid and unpaid leave and participate in our health insurance and life, disability and accident insurance programs. During 2020, we conducted an employee benefits survey to gain a deeper understanding of how our various benefit programs are valued by our employees, and feedback from this survey was used to enhance our employee benefit program offerings for 2021. We also offer retirement benefits through our 401(k) plan which includes discretionary Company-matching contributions. Diversity and Inclusion &#8211; Our commitment to diversity extends across every division and discipline of our business. We leverage multiple social media platforms, including veteran, diversity and industry sites to expand our reach for diverse talent. We intend to continue evaluating our use of human capital measures or objectives in managing our business, such as the factors we employ or seek to employ in the attraction, development and retention of personnel and the maintenance of diversity in our workforce. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A for further discussion of our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.SafetyWe are committed to the safety and health of our employees and subcontractors and believe that a strong safety culture is a critical element of our success. We continue to improve and maintain a stringent safety assurance program designed to ensure the safety of our employees and subcontractors and allow us to remain in compliance with all applicable federal and state mandated safety regulations. We are committed to maintaining a well-trained workforce and providing timely instruction to ensure our employees have the knowledge and skills to perform their work safely while maintaining the highest standards of quality. We provide continuous safety education and training to employees and subcontractors to ensure they are ready for the challenges inherent in all our projects. Our employees commence training on their first day of employment with a comprehensive orientation class that addresses Company policies and procedures and provides clear expectations for working safely. We have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol use in the workplace. We support this policy through the application of a comprehensive drug and alcohol screening program that includes initial screenings for all employees and periodic random screenings throughout employment. Additionally, we require our subcontractors to follow alcohol and drug screening policies substantially the same as ours.Our employees are given opportunities to be a part of a dedicated safety committee which is comprised of peer-elected craft employees and members of management to assist in supporting our efforts to continuously improve safety performance. A safety component is also included in our annual incentive program guidelines for our executive officers and other key employees. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A for further discussion of our safety.&#160;&#160;We are continuing to take actions to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on our operations while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and subcontractors. We have initiated measures that include ongoing communications with our leadership teams to anticipate and proactively address COVID-19 impacts, work-place distancing of employees (including allowing some employees to work remotely) and regular monitoring of office and yard personnel for compliance. We are also monitoring employee and visitor temperatures prior to entering our facilities&#59; have implemented employee and visitor wellness questionnaires&#59; increased our monitoring of employee absenteeism and the reasons for such absences&#59; and initiated protocols for employees returning from absences, including employees that have tested positive for COVID-19, or have come in contact with individuals that tested positive for COVID-19. In addition, we have installed hand sanitizing stations and taken additional actions to more frequently sanitize our facilities. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A for further discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our operations.Quality AssuranceWe use modern welding and fabrication technology, and all of our fabrication projects are executed in accordance with industry standards, specifications and regulations, including those published by the American Petroleum Institute, the American Welding Society, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American Bureau of Shipping, the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Navy and customer specifications. We maintain training programs for technical fitting and welding instruction in order to prepare and upgrade our skilled labor workforce and maintain high standards of quality. In addition, we maintain on-site facilities for the non-destructive testing of all welds, a process performed by an independent contractor.Our quality management systems are certified as ISO 9001-2015 programs. ISO 9001-2015 is an internationally recognized verification system for quality management overseen by the International Standard Organization based in Geneva, Switzerland. The certification is based on a review of our programs and procedures designed to maintain and enhance quality production and is subject to annual review and full recertification every three years. Our last full recertification occurred in March 2020.CustomersOur principal customers include U.S. and, to a lesser extent, international energy producers&#59; refining, petrochemical, LNG, industrial, power and marine operators&#59; EPC companies&#59; and certain agencies of the U.S. government. A large portion of our revenue in any given year may be generated by only a few customers, although not necessarily the same customers from year to year. &#160;&#8226; For 2020, two customers accounted for 46% of our consolidated revenue, which related to the construction of three research vessels and five towing, salvage and rescue ships within our Shipyard Division&#59; &#160;&#8226; For 2019, four customers accounted for 54% of our consolidated revenue, which related to the construction of three research vessels and three towing, salvage and rescue ships for two customers within our Shipyard Division and the expansion of a paddle wheel riverboat and offshore hook-up and installation services for two customers within our Fabrication &#38; Services Division&#59; and &#160;&#8226; For 2018, three customers accounted for 44% of our consolidated revenue, which related to the construction of harbor tug vessels for two customers within our Shipyard Division and offshore hook-up and installation services for a customer within our Fabrication &#38; Services Division. Certain of our customers have requested to renegotiate pricing and suspended contracts in our backlog, and bidding activities for several new project opportunities have been delayed or suspended as a result of COVID-19. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A and &#8220;Overview&#8221; and &#8220;New Awards and Backlog&#8221; in Item 7 for further discussion of our backlog by significant customers and the impacts of COVID-19 on our customers. ContractingOur revenue is derived from customer contracts and agreements that are awarded on a competitively bid and negotiated basis using a range of contracting options, including fixed-price, unit-rate and T&#38;M. Our contracts primarily relate to the fabrication of steel structures, modules and marine vessels, and certain service arrangements. Such contracts vary in duration depending on the size and complexity of the project.Revenue for our fixed-price and unit-rate contracts is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, based on contract costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract costs. Contract costs include direct costs, such as materials and labor, and indirect costs attributable to contract activity. Material costs that are significant to a contract and do not reflect an accurate measure of project completion are excluded from the determination of our contract progress. Revenue for such materials is only recognized to the extent of costs incurred.Revenue for our T&#38;M contracts is recognized at contracted rates when the work is performed, the costs are incurred and collection is reasonably assured. Our T&#38;M contracts provide for labor and materials to be billed at rates specified within the contract. The consideration from the customer directly corresponds to the value of our performance completed at the time of invoicing. &#160;Certain of our customers have requested to renegotiate pricing and suspended contracts in our backlog, and bidding activities for several new project opportunities have been delayed or suspended as a result of COVID-19 as discussed above . See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A, &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; in Item 7, and Note 1 and Note 2 of our Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of our contracting and revenue recognition. See also &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A and &#8220; Overview&#8221; in Item 7 for further discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on our customers and operations. New Awards and BacklogNew project awards represent expected revenue values of commitments received during a given period, including scope growth on existing commitments. A commitment represents authorization from our customer to begin work or purchase materials pursuant to a written agreement, letter of intent or other form of authorization. Backlog represents the unrecognized revenue for our new project awards and may differ from the value of future performance obligations for our contracts required to be disclosed under Topic 606 and presented in Note 2 of our Financial Statements in Item 8. In general, a performance obligation is a contractual obligation to construct and\/or transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Backlog includes our performance obligations at December 31, 2020, plus signed contracts that are temporarily suspended or under protest that may not meet the criteria to be reported as future performance obligations under Topic 606 but represent future work that we believe will be performed. We believe that backlog, a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors. New project awards and backlog may vary significantly each reporting period based on the timing of our major new contract commitments.Projects in our backlog are generally subject to delay, suspension, termination, or an increase or reduction in scope at the option of the customer, although the customer is required to pay us for work performed and materials purchased through the date of termination, suspension, or reduction in scope. Depending on the size of the project, the delay, suspension, termination or increase or reduction in scope of any one contract could significantly impact our backlog and change the expected amount and timing of revenue recognized. See Note 2 of our Financial Statements in Item 8 for a reconciliation of our future performance obligations under Topic 606 (the most comparable GAAP measure) to our reported backlog.At December 31, 2020, our backlog was $371.6 million, of which approximately 57% is anticipated to be recognized as revenue beyond 2021. See &#8220;New Awards and Backlog&#8221; in Item 7 for further discussion of our new awards and backlog.SeasonalityOur operations may be subject to seasonal variations due to weather conditions and available daylight hours. Although we have large, covered fabrication facilities, a significant amount of our construction activities take place outdoors, and accordingly, the number of labor hours worked may decline during the winter months due to unfavorable weather conditions and a decrease in daylight hours. In addition, the seasonality of oil and gas industry activity in the Gulf Coast region may also affect our operations. Our offshore oil and gas customers often schedule the completion of their projects during the summer months in order to take advantage of more favorable weather during such months. Further, rainy weather, tropical storms, hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the GOM may also affect our operations. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A for further discussion of the seasonal impacts to our operations.CompetitionWe operate within highly competitive markets which are significantly impacted by oil and gas prices and government spending. Declines in oil and gas prices and limits on government spending can create excess capacity and under-utilization of our competitor's facilities, resulting in more intense competition in the bidding process for new project awards. Further, there are numerous regional, national and global competitors that offer similar services to those offered by each of our operating divisions. These competitors may be larger than us with more resources and facilities in both the U.S. and abroad. Competition with foreign competitors can also be challenging as such competitors often have lower operating costs and lower wage rates, and foreign governments often use subsidies and incentives to create local jobs, impose import duties and fees on products and tax foreign operators. In addition, as a result of recent technological innovations, decreased transportation costs incurred by our customers when exporting structures from foreign locations to the GOM or Gulf Coast may hinder our ability to successfully bid against foreign competitors for large projects. Uncertainties with respect to tariffs on materials and fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and other factors, may also impact our ability to compete effectively.Although we believe price and the contractor&#8217;s ability to meet a customer&#8217;s delivery schedule and project requirements are principal factors in determining which contractor is awarded a project, customers also consider, among other things, a contractor&#8217;s past project experience, the availability of technically capable personnel, facility capacity and location, production efficiency, condition of equipment, reputation, safety record, customer relations and financial strength. We believe that our strategic location, competitive pricing, expertise in fabricating and servicing onshore and offshore structures and vessels, and the certification of our facilities as ISO 9001-2015 will enable us to continue to compete effectively for projects. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A for further discussion of our competitive landscape.&#160;&#160;Government and Environmental RegulationOur operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of increasingly complex and stringent foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and other regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances. Compliance with many of these laws is becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive. These laws may impose &#8220;strict liability&#8221; for damages to natural resources and threats to public health and safety, rendering a party liable for the environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party. Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to the health and safety of our employees, primarily the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations promulgated thereunder. Various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies require certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. We believe that we have all material permits, licenses and certificates necessary for the conduct of our existing business. Our employees may engage in certain activities, including interconnect piping and other service activities conducted on offshore platforms, activities performed on spud barges owned or chartered by us, and marine vessel fabrication and repair activities performed at our facilities and barges owned by us, that are covered in either the provisions of the Jones Act or U.S. Longshoreman and Harbor Workers Act (&#8220;USL&#38;H&#8221;). These laws make the liability limits established under state workers&#8217; compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and permit them or their representatives to pursue actions against us for damages or job-related injuries, with generally no limitations on our potential liability.Many aspects of our operations and properties are materially affected by federal, state and local regulations, as well as certain international conventions and private industry organizations. The exploration and development of oil and gas properties located on the outer continental shelf of the U.S. is regulated primarily by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and Enforcement of the Department of Interior, which is responsible for the administration of federal regulations under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act requiring the construction of offshore platforms located on the outer continental shelf to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications. Violations of these regulations and related laws can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctions curtailing operations. We believe that our operations are in compliance with these and all other regulations affecting the fabrication of platforms for delivery to the outer continental shelf of the U.S. In addition, demand for our services from the oil and gas and marine industries can be affected by changes in taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations affecting these industries. It is also possible that the new Biden Administration will impose additional environmental regulations that will restrict federal oil and gas leasing, permitting or drilling practices on public lands. For example, President Biden has already issued orders temporarily suspending leasing or permitting of oil and gas activities on federal lands and waters, and the President has also proposed a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and waters. Offshore construction and drilling in certain areas has also been opposed by environmental groups and, in certain areas, has been restricted. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental actions are taken that prohibit or restrict offshore construction and drilling or impose environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general and the offshore construction industry in particular, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. We cannot determine to what extent future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing regulations.The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended and similar laws provide for responses to and liability for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Additionally, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, each as amended, and similar foreign, state or local counterparts to these federal laws, regulate air emissions, water discharges, hazardous substances and wastes, and require public disclosure related to the use of various hazardous substances. Compliance with such environmental laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits or other authorizations for certain activities and compliance with various standards or procedural requirements. We believe that our facilities are in substantial compliance with current regulatory standards.In addition, our operations are subject to extensive government regulation by the U.S. Coast Guard, as well as various private industry organizations such as the American Petroleum Institute, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, American Welding Society and the American Bureau of Shipping.Further, our operations have been impacted by national, state and local authorities recommending or mandating COVID-19 physical distancing and\/or quarantine and isolation measures on large portions of the population, including mandatory business closures in the areas in which we operate.&#160;&#160;Our compliance with these laws and regulations has entailed certain additional expenses and changes in operating procedures&#59; however, we believe that compliance efforts have not resulted in a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation, more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require additional expenditures by us.

Overview We are a global leader in the development and commercialization of foundational technologies for the wireless industry. Our technologies and products are used in mobile devices and other wireless products, including network equipment, broadband gateway equipment, consumer electronic devices and other connected devices. Our inventions have helped power the growth in smartphones, which have connected billions of people. We are a leader in 3G (third generation), 4G (fourth generation) and 5G (fifth generation) wireless technologies. Our technologies and products are also used in industry segments or applications beyond mobile, including automotive and internet of things (IoT) (which includes connectivity and networking, computing and fixed wireless broadband), among others. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing of our intellectual property, including patents and other rights. The foundational technologies we invent help power the modern mobile experience, impacting how the world connects, computes and communicates. We share these inventions broadly through our licensing program, enabling wide ecosystem access to technologies at the core of mobile innovation, and through the sale of our wireless integrated circuit platforms (also known as chips or chipsets) and other products. We collaborate across the ecosystem, including manufacturers, operators, developers, system integrators, cloud providers, governments and industry standards organizations, to enable a global environment to drive continued progress and growth. We have a long history of driving innovation. We have played and continue to play a leading role in developing system level inventions that serve as the foundation for 3G, 4G and 5G wireless technologies. This includes the CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) families of technologies, with the latter encompassing LTE (Long Term Evolution) and 5G NR (New Radio), which, along with TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), are the primary digital technologies currently used to transmit voice or data over radio waves using a public or private cellular wireless network. We own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications and trade secrets, applicable to products that implement any version of CDMA and\/or OFDMA technologies. Companies in the mobile industry generally recognize that any company seeking to develop, manufacture and\/or sell devices or infrastructure equipment that use CDMA-based and\/or OFDMA-based technologies will require a license or other rights to use our patents. We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other wireless devices, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, GPS (Global Positioning System) and Bluetooth. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures. Our patents cover a wide range of technologies across the entire wireless system (including wireless devices and network infrastructure equipment), not just the portion of such patented technologies incorporated into chipsets. We are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on 3G\/4G\/5G and other technologies for use in mobile devices, wireless networks, broadband gateway equipment, consumer electronic devices, other devices used in IoT and automotive systems for telematics and infotainment. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and\/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including Qualcomm Government Technologies or QGOV, our cloud AI inference processing initiative and other technology and service initiatives. Industry Trends As the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. The scale and pace of innovation in the mobile industry, especially around connectivity and computing technologies, is also impacting industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models and new experiences. Our inventions and licensing program have been integral to, and provided foundational technologies for, the evolution of the mobile industry. Advancing connectivity. 3G and 4G mobile broadband technologies have been key innovations of mobile, providing users with fast, reliable, always-on connectivity. As of September 30, 2020, there were approximately 6.2 billion 3G\/4G connections globally, representing 78% of total mobile connections (GSMA Intelligence, November 2020). By 2024, global 3G\/4G connections are projected to reach 6.5 billion, with approximately 89% of these connections in emerging regions and China (GSMA Intelligence, November 2020). 3G networks, first launched in the early 2000s, ushered in the mobile broadband era, serving as a true alternative to traditional desktop internet service, allowing users to experience the internet from virtually anywhere. The combination of faster processing and larger screens with mobile broadband connectivity has transformed how people interact with information and with each other. The launch of 4G in 2010 brought true mobile broadband connectivity to wireless networks. With its faster data rates and greater capacity, 4G has become the foundational technology to many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming. 3G and 4G mobile broadband technologies have also helped to strengthen economic and social development globally by providing access to government and healthcare resources and creating new educational and entrepreneurial opportunities. With the first 5G global specifications defined in 2018 by 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), an industry standards development organization, initial commercial 5G network deployments and device launches, which focus on enhanced mobile broadband services, began in 2019 and will continue into 2021 and beyond. As of September 30, 2020, more than 110 operators have deployed 5G commercial networks in nearly 50 countries and territories, and over 400 operators are investing in 5G (GSA, October 2020). Calendar year 2020 5G global smartphone shipments are expected to reach more than 200 million units (IDC, Mobile Phone Tracker, 2020Q2). With support for multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity, 5G enhances mobile broadband services, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, near-instantaneous access to cloud services, multi-player cloud gaming and AR\/VR\/XR (augmented reality\/virtual reality\/extended reality) applications. 5G also brings more capacity and efficiency to cellular networks, which may enable operators to reduce their operating costs and offer new unlimited mobile data plans. The second 5G global specifications defined in 2020 by 3GPP (Release 16) and future releases of 5G are expected to expand the reach of the technology to industries beyond mobile to create new services, business models and experiences, such as automated driving built on the concepts of computer vision, sensor fusion and vehicle-to-vehicle communications. We believe 5G will also enable artificial intelligence-based platforms designed to bring greater autonomy and wireless connectivity to factory automation for more reconfigurable manufacturing and other industrial applications (known as industrial IoT) through ultra-reliable, ultra-low latency communication links. We also expect 5G to connect a significant number of &#8220;things&#8221; (also known as IoT), including among others, consumer, enterprise, retail, wearable and voice and music devices, with connectivity designed to meet diverse (low) power and cost requirements, as well as to address both low- and high-complexity applications. Most 5G devices include multimode support for 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi, enabling service continuity where 5G has yet to be deployed and simultaneous connectivity across 4G technology, while also allowing mobile operators to utilize current network deployments. At the same time, 4G is expected to continue to evolve in parallel with the further development of 5G and become fundamental to many of the key 5G technologies (through multi-connectivity), such as 5G massive IoT leveraging LTE IoT, support for unlicensed spectrum and gigabit LTE user data speeds. The first phase of 5G networks predominantly supports mobile broadband services for smartphones, both in lower spectrum bands below 7 GHz (commonly referred to as sub-6, sub-7 or Frequency Range 1) and in higher bands above 24 GHz (commonly referred to as millimeter wave (mmWave) or Frequency Range 2). As with previous generations of mobile networks, it will take time to deploy new 5G networks; however, we expect that deployment of 5G networks will be at a faster pace as compared to the transition from 3G to 4G technologies. Consumer demand in smartphones. From October 2019 through September 2020, approximately 1.2 billion smartphones are estimated to have shipped globally, representing a year-over-year decrease of approximately 9% primarily driven by the global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which negatively impacted consumer demand for smartphones and replacement rates (IDC, Mobile Phone Tracker, 2020Q2). Smartphone shipments in calendar 2021 are expected to increase by approximately 9% year-over-year (IDC Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, 2020Q2), reflecting a gradual recovery in demand for smartphones and replacement rates from the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking beyond 2021, we expect replacement rates to moderately lengthen when compared to pre-COVID-19 levels, particularly in developed regions and China, as consumer demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and\/or innovation cycles. Consumer demand for new types of experiences, combined with the needs of mobile operators and device manufacturers to provide differentiated features and services, is driving continued innovation within the smartphone industry, across connectivity, processing, AI, multimedia, imaging, audio and more. As a result, the smartphone continues to be the go-to device for social networking, music and video streaming, gaming, email and web browsing, among others. It is expected that the evolution of 5G will fuel further innovation within the smartphone industry to support more intuitive and immersive experiences. Transforming other industries. With their significant scale and highly integrated solutions, industries beyond mobile, including automotive and IoT, among others, are leveraging the same technology innovations found in today&#8217;s leading smartphones to enhance existing products and services as well as to create new products and services. Our inventions that contribute to the formation of advanced cellular technologies, such as 3G, 4G and now 5G connectivity, are helping to drive, and in the case of 5G accelerate the pace of, this transformation. For example, in the automotive industry, approximately 70% of new vehicles produced in 2025 are projected to have cellular connectivity, compared to 48% in 2019 (Strategy Analytics, October 2020). In addition, the installed base of non-mobile devices with cellular connectivity, which includes IoT devices among others, is projected to grow 190% between 2020 and 2024 (ABI Research, October 2020). Wireless Technologies Overview The demand in the use of wireless devices worldwide and the demand for data services and applications requires continuous innovation to improve the user experience, support new services, increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and allow for dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. We have a long history of heavily investing in research and development and have developed foundational technologies that drive the continued evolution of the wireless industry, including CDMA and OFDMA. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred licensees, including leading wireless device and infrastructure manufacturers. Cellular wireless technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories. TDMA-based. TDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency channel by dividing the signal into different time slots. Most of these systems are classified as 2G technology. The main example of TDMA-based technologies is GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications). The transition of wireless devices from 2G to 3G\/4G and the deployment of 5G technologies continued around the world with estimated 3G\/4G\/5G connections up 7% year-over-year (GSMA Intelligence, November 2020). As of September 30, 2020, there were approximately 1.6 billion GSM connections worldwide, representing approximately 20% of total cellular connections, down from 25% as of September 30, 2019 (GSMA Intelligence, November 2020). CDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology. There are a number of variants of CDMA-based technologies deployed around the world, in particular CDMA2000, EV-DO (Evolution Data Optimized), WCDMA (Wideband CDMA) and TD-SCDMA (Time Division-Synchronous CDMA) (deployed exclusively in China). CDMA-based technologies provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over 2G technology. As of September 30, 2020, there were approximately 1.9 billion CDMA-based connections worldwide, representing approximately 24% of total cellular connections, down from 26% as of September 30, 2019 as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies (GSMA Intelligence, November 2020). OFDMA-based. OFDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency band and time by allocating different subcarriers to individual users. Most of the OFDMA-based technologies deployed prior to 2020 are classified as 4G technology. 5G heavily leverages OFDMA-based technologies. 3GPP developed 4G specifications through the standardization of the radio component (LTE) and the core network component (Enhanced Packet Core or EPC). Similarly, 3GPP has developed 5G specifications through the specification of the radio component (NR) and the core network component (5G Core or 5GC). Unlike 4G that has fixed Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) parameterization, 5G has multiple OFDM parameterizations to address a wide range of spectrum and use cases. We continue to play a significant role in the further development of LTE-based technologies, such as Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), enhanced Machine Type Communications (eMTC) and Enhanced TV broadcast (EnTV), in addition to the core LTE operation evolution, such as enhancements for mobility and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) operation. LTE is incorporated in 3GPP specifications beginning with Release 8 and uses OFDMA in the downlink and single carrier FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access) in the uplink. LTE has two modes, FDD (Frequency Division Duplex) and TDD (Time Division Duplex), to support paired and unpaired spectrum, respectively, and continues to evolve as 3GPP defines new specifications. The principal benefit of LTE is its ability to leverage a wide range of spectrum (bandwidths of up to 20 MHz or more through aggregation). LTE is designed to seamlessly interwork with 3G technologies through multimode devices. LTE Advanced brings many more enhancements, including carrier aggregation, advanced multi-antenna techniques and optimizations for small cells. Apart from improving the performance of existing networks, there are also enhancements under the umbrella of LTE Advanced Pro, including LTE Direct for proximity-based device-to-device discovery, improved LTE broadcast, optimizations of narrowband communications designed for IoT (known as eMTC and NB-IoT) and the ability to use LTE Advanced in unlicensed spectrum (LTE Unlicensed), as well as in shared spectrum bands in various regions (such as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service, or CBRS, in the United States). There are multiple options for deploying LTE Unlicensed for different deployment scenarios. &#8226; LAA (Licensed Assisted Access), introduced as part of 3GPP Release 13, aggregates unlicensed and licensed spectrum in the downlink and is being deployed globally by mobile operators. LAA is a key technology for many operators with limited licensed spectrum to deliver Gigabit LTE speeds. &#8226; eLAA (enhanced LAA), introduced as part of 3GPP Release 14, is an evolution of LAA. eLAA enables aggregation of unlicensed and licensed spectrum in the uplink. Beginning with Release 14, 3GPP specifications provide enhancements specifically for vehicular communications known as cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), which includes both direct communication (vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-pedestrian) in dedicated spectrum that is independent of a cellular network and cellular communications with networks in traditional mobile broadband licensed spectrum. C-V2X is designed to serve as the foundation for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling vehicles to communicate with each other and everything around them, providing non-line-of-sight awareness for enhanced road safety and traffic efficiency. 3GPP Release 16, which was completed in July 2020, incorporates 5G features for C-V2X, such as higher throughput, lower latency and increased reliability capabilities to enable a higher level of performance and predictability required for automated driving and other advanced safety use cases. As of September 30, 2020, there were approximately 4.3 billion global LTE connections worldwide, representing approximately 55% of total cellular connections, up from 49% as of September 30, 2019 (GSMA Intelligence, November 2020). The wireless industry is actively developing and commercializing 5G technologies. Initial commercial 5G network deployments and device launches began in calendar 2019 and continued throughout 2020. We expect that 5G network deployments and device launches will increase over the next several years. Many of our inventions at the core of 3G and 4G serve as foundational technologies for 5G. 5G is designed to transform the role of wireless technologies and already incorporates or soon will incorporate advancements on 3G\/4G features available today, including device-to-device capabilities and the use of all different types of spectrum (including licensed, unlicensed and shared spectrum). We continue to play a significant role in driving advancements in 5G, including contributing to 3GPP standardization activities that are defining the continued evolution of 5G NR and 5GC standards. The first global set of 5G standards is incorporated in 3GPP specifications starting from Release 15, which was initially completed in March 2018. Release 15 enables different architecture deployment choices of 5G networks while sharing the same radio access technology. This is due to 5G&#8217;s ability to target diverse services with very different technical requirements (from enhanced mobile broadband to massive IoT to mission critical services), its utilization of diverse types of spectrum (from the low bands to mmWave bands) and its ability to support diverse types of deployment scenarios. Predominant technological components of 5G include the ability to address ultra-reliable, low-latency communication, new channel coding schemes to efficiently support large data blocks, MIMO to increase coverage and network capacity and mobile mmWave to increase the data rate offered to users. 5G uses OFDMA in the downlink and either OFDMA or single carrier FDMA in the uplink depending on the use case. Like 3G and 4G, 5G supports carrier aggregation across spectrum bands, across FDD and TDD and across licensed and unlicensed spectrum (starting with Release 16), and 5G also supports dual connectivity across 4G and 5G. A key benefit of 5G is its ability to take advantage of very wide channel bandwidth such as 400\/100 MHz (compared to LTE&#8217;s 20 MHz maximum bandwidth, which requires carrier aggregation to combine spectrum beyond 20 MHz). As with previous cellular generations, 5G is designed to support seamless compatibility with 2G\/3G\/4G technologies through multimode devices. 5G is the first generation of cellular wireless communication systems to use transmissions at mmWave bands, which creates certain challenges including coverage limitations and blockages, heightened costs and power constraints. In order to address these challenges, we have been a leader in designing RFFE modules and RF filter products that use adaptive beamforming (which spatially concentrates radio energy in a given beam direction to extend the range) and that enable the efficient tracking and switching of beams in accordance with varying radio conditions. mmWave deployments rely on small cells (low-powered cellular base stations typically used for increased system capacity and which may have already incorporated Gigabit LTE) to allow for faster, more reliable mobile service with transmissions at mmWave bands. Release 16 not only introduced enhancements to 5G mobile broadband experiences (e.g., more capacity, improved coverage, mobility and better device power efficiency), but also expanded 5G technologies into new use cases and industries. For example, to better enable new industrial IoT use cases, such as factory automation and other mission critical applications, Release 16 added support for private 5G networks, efficient wireless Ethernet over 5G, 5G Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and further enhanced ultra-reliable low latency communications. Release 16 also fulfilled the 5G vision of supporting different spectrum types by expanding 5G into unlicensed spectrum with 5G NR Unlicensed (NR-U). Release 16 NR-U focused on sub-7GHz operation, specifically 5GHz and 6GHz bands, and Release 17 will expand NR-U to support higher bands such as 60 GHz. High-precision positioning was another focus area in Release 16. Accurate device positioning is a key enabler for many applications, such as public safety and indoor navigation. Release 16 added new capabilities for 5G positioning, supporting techniques such as multi-cell roundtrip time, angle of arrival\/departure and time difference of arrival. Release 16 addressed the growing needs of low-power, wide-area IoT use cases by allowing in-band deployments of NB-IoT and eMTC in 5G carriers, as well as supporting these low-complexity IoT technologies with the new 5G core network. Additionally, to make mmWave densification more cost efficient, Release 16 introduced integrated access and backhaul that allows a base station to provide both wireless access for devices and wireless backhaul connectivity, thereby eliminating the need for a wired backhaul. Other (non-cellular) wireless technologies. There are other, non-cellular wireless technologies that have also been broadly adopted. Wireless Local Area Networks. Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), such as Wi-Fi, link two or more nearby devices wirelessly and usually provide connectivity through an access point. We are actively involved in innovative programs developed in the context of the Wi-Fi Alliance, a non-profit organization that drives global Wi-Fi adoption and evolution. Wi-Fi systems are based primarily on standards developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 802.11 Working Group. Amendments of the 802.11 standard are commonly referred to by the names made popular by the Wi-Fi Alliance (for example, 802.11ax is known as Wi-Fi 6). Wi-Fi 6, a recent amendment to 802.11, adds advanced features such as downlink and uplink OFDMA and uplink multiple-user MIMO. This technology primarily targets connectivity for mobile devices, tablets, laptops and other consumer electronic devices using the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz spectrums. Up to 1200MHz of new spectrum has been added in the 6GHz band in the United States, which triples the available spectrum for Wi-Fi, which can be used by new Wi-Fi 6 extended devices. For 60GHz mmWave technology, 802.11ay adds wider channel bandwidth and the use of MIMO to the existing 802.11ad (also known as Gigabit Wi-Fi or WiGig) standard. 802.11ah targets sub-1 GHz spectrum. We played a leading role in the development of 802.11ac, 802.11ax, 802.11ay, 802.11ah and 802.11ad, and continue to play a lead role in the evolution of the 802.11 family of standards with the development of the new 802.11be standard, which is expected to be known as Wi-Fi 7. Bluetooth. Bluetooth is a wireless personal area network that provides wireless connectivity between devices over short distances ranging from a few centimeters to approximately one hundred meters. Bluetooth technology provides wireless connectivity to a wide range of fixed or mobile consumer electronic devices. Bluetooth functionalities are standardized by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group in various versions of the specification (from 1.0 to 5.2), which include different functionalities, such as enhanced data rate, low energy and mesh technologies. We are a leading contributor to Bluetooth technologies in the areas of mobile devices, audio and mesh technologies. Location Positioning Technologies. Location positioning technologies continue to evolve in order to deliver an enhanced commercial location experience and comply with new mandates on location for E911 (enhanced 911) calls. We are a key developer of the Assisted-GPS (A-GPS), Assisted Global Navigation Satellite System (A-GNSS) and WLAN positioning technologies used in most cellular handsets today. For uses requiring the best reliability and accuracy for E911 services and navigational based services, A-GPS, A-GNSS and WLAN provide leading-edge solutions. In 3GPP Release 16, we led the standardization of many 4G and 5G-based positioning capabilities. The industry continues to evolve to support additional inputs for improving the location experience. Our products and intellectual property now support multiple constellations for A-GNSS, including: GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, NavIC and BeiDou; Wi-Fi-based and Bluetooth-based positioning for WLAN, including Wi-Fi RSSI (received signal strength indication) and Wi-Fi RTT (round-trip time) signals for indoor location; observed time difference of arrival positioning for LTE access (e.g., in rural and indoor areas); and third-party inertial sensors. The combination of these different location solutions is used to ensure accurate location availability in all areas. Other Significant Technologies used in Cellular and Certain Consumer Electronic Devices and Networks . We have played and continue to play a leading role in developing and\/or have acquired many of the other technologies used across the wireless system, including in cellular handsets and certain other consumer electronic devices and networks, such as: &#8226; on-device AI features, including machine learning platforms and the application of AI and machine learning techniques to edge computing and other use cases; &#8226; graphics and display processing functionality; &#8226; video coding based on the HEVC (High Efficiency Video Codec) standard, which is being deployed to support 4K video and immersive media content and the next generation VVC (Versatile Video Codec) standard, which is designed to power the creation and consumption of rich digital media experiences; &#8226; audio coding, including EVS (enhanced voice services) and MPEG-H 3D Audio; &#8226; the latest version of 3GPP&#8217;s codec for multimedia use and for voice\/speech use; &#8226; multimedia transport, including MPEG-DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) enabling advanced multimedia experiences; &#8226; camera and camcorder functions; &#8226; operating system and user interface features; &#8226; AR\/VR\/XR features enabling new types of user experiences; &#8226; security and content protection systems for enhanced device security without compromising the user experience and ultrasonic fingerprint readers for single touch authentication; &#8226; volatile (LP-DDR4, 5) and non-volatile (eMMC) memory and related controllers; &#8226; fast charging features, enabling devices to charge quickly, safely and efficiently; &#8226; power management systems for improved battery life and device charging; and &#8226; System on Chip (SoC) architecture, low-power computing and other optimization techniques.

Our Qualcomm&#174; Adreno&#8482; graphics processing units are designed to deliver high quality graphics performance for visually rich 3D gaming and user interfaces. In addition to the highly integrated core system-on-chip (SoC), we also design and supply supporting components, including the RF, PM (power management), audio, codecs, speaker amps and additional wireless connectivity integrated circuits. These supporting components, in addition to our cellular modems and application processors comprising our core SoC, are also sold as individual components. The combination of the Snapdragon SoC, system software and supporting components provide an overall platform with optimized performance and efficiency, enabling manufacturers to design and deliver powerful, slim and power-efficient devices ready for integration with the complex cellular networks worldwide. We have also integrated our Snapdragon platform with our RFFE components to create our Snapdragon 5G modem-RF systems, the world&#8217;s first commercial modem-to-antenna 5G solution designed to maximize data speeds and performance, support superior call connectivity and coverage, and extend battery life on mobile devices. Our portfolio of RF products includes Qualcomm&#174; RFFE components that are designed to simplify the RF design for 5G front-end, LTE multimode and multiband mobile devices, including sub-6 GHz and mmWave devices, to reduce power consumption and to improve radio performance. QCT offers an advanced portfolio of RFFE products primarily for mobile devices, in addition to broadband gateway equipment, infrastructure equipment, laptops, automotive, industrial IoT and other IoT applications. Our technologies provide comprehensive RFFE product offerings with system level performance from the modem and transceiver to the antenna that include complex 4G\/5G transmit and receive modules, power tracking, tuning systems, filtering, multimode-multiband power amplification, low noise amplifiers and mmWave antenna solutions, in addition to discrete filtering products across mobile, automotive, industrial IoT and other IoT industries.

Our networking products include Wi-Fi, Ethernet and Powerline chips, network processors and software. These products help enable home and business networks to support the growing number of connected devices, digital media and data services. Other than for our RFFE modules and RF filter products, QCT utilizes a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Therefore, we primarily rely on third-parties to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits based primarily on our proprietary designs and test programs. Our suppliers also are responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the package assembly and test manufacturing processes. The semiconductor package supports the electrical contacts that connect the integrated circuit to a circuit board. Die cut from silicon wafers are the essential components of all of our integrated circuits and a significant portion of the total integrated circuit cost. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Under the turnkey model, our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing model, we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-parties for manufacturing services such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and the majority of our final test requirements. The primary foundry suppliers for our various digital, analog\/mixed-signal, RF and PM integrated circuits are Global Foundries, Samsung Electronics, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and United Microelectronics. The primary semiconductor assembly and test suppliers are Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Amkor Technology, Siliconware Precision Industries and STATSChipPAC. The majority of our foundry and semiconductor assembly and test suppliers are located in the Asia-Pacific region. QCT primarily uses internal fabrication facilities to manufacture RFFE modules and RF filter products, and its manufacturing operations consist of front-end and back-end processes. The front-end processes primarily take place at manufacturing facilities located in Germany and Singapore and involve the imprinting of substrate wafers with the structure and circuitry required for the products to function (also known as wafer fabrication). The back-end processes include the assembly, packaging and test of RFFE modules and RF filter products and their preparation for distribution. The back-end manufacturing facilities are located in China and Singapore. QCT&#8217;s sales are primarily made through standard purchase orders for delivery of products. QCT generally allows customers to reschedule delivery dates within a defined time frame and to cancel orders prior to shipment with or without payment of a penalty, depending on when the order is canceled. The industry in which QCT operates is intensely competitive. QCT competes worldwide with a number of U.S. and international designers and manufacturers of semiconductors. As a result of global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, technological changes, lengthening replacement cycles for mobile devices, device manufacturer concentrations and the potential for further industry consolidation, we anticipate the industry to remain very competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors for our products include performance, level of integration, quality, compliance with industry standards, price, time-to-market, system cost, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation, growth and scaling of distribution channels, desire by certain customers to use multiple suppliers and customer support. QCT also competes in both single-mode and multimode environments against alternative communications technologies. Additional competitive factors exist for QCT product offerings that have expanded into adjacent industry segments or applications beyond mobile, including automotive and IoT. The automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in a significant barrier to entry and may result in increased costs. QCT&#8217;s current competitors include, but are not limited to, companies such as Broadcom, HiSilicon, MediaTek, Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Samsung, Skyworks, Texas Instruments and UNISOC (formally known as Spreadtrum Communications). QCT also faces competition from products internally developed by our customers, including some of our largest customers, and from some early-stage companies. Our competitors devote significant amounts of their financial, technical and other resources to develop and market competitive products and, in some cases, to develop and adopt competitive digital communication or signal processing technologies, and those efforts may materially and adversely affect us. Although we have attained a significant position in the wireless industry, many of our current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to use our competitors&#8217; integrated circuit products, to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products, or sell such products to others, or to utilize alternative technologies; lower cost structures or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies, competitors or OEMs that sell devices that do not contain our integrated circuit products; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and OEMs in certain geographic regions (such as China); more experience in adjacent industry segments or applications beyond mobile (such as automotive and IoT); and a more established presence in certain regions. QTL Segment . QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which, among other rights, includes certain patent rights essential to and\/or useful in the manufacture, sale and\/or use of certain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD, LTE and\/or OFDMA-based 5G standards and their derivatives. We grant licenses or otherwise provide rights to use our cellular standard-essential patents (including 3G, 4G and 5G) for both single-mode and multimode devices on a worldwide basis, and our standard practice in China is to offer our cellular standard-essential Chinese patents (for 3G, 4G and, now, 5G) for devices sold for use in China separately from our other patents. We also offer licenses to our cellular standard-essential patents together with other Qualcomm patents that may be useful to such licensed products for licensees that desire to obtain the commercial benefits of receiving such broad patent rights from us. Since 2018, an increasing number of new and existing licensees have elected to enter into worldwide license agreements covering only our cellular standard-essential patents. Going forward, we continue to anticipate that a significant portion of QTL&#8217;s licensing revenues will be derived from licensees that have entered into license agreements covering only Qualcomm&#8217;s cellular standard-essential patents. Our licensees manufacture wireless products including mobile devices (including handsets), other consumer devices (e.g., tablets and laptops), plug-in end user data modem cards and embedded modules for incorporation into machine-to-machine devices and certain end user products (excluding handsets and tablets), as well as infrastructure equipment required to establish and operate a network and equipment to test networks and cellular devices. Since our founding in 1985, we have focused heavily on technology development and innovation. These efforts have resulted in a leading intellectual property portfolio related to foundational, system level technologies for the wireless industry. We have an extensive portfolio of United States and foreign patents, and we continue to pursue patent applications around the world. Our patents have broad coverage in many countries, including Brazil, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the United States and countries in Europe. A substantial portion of our patents and patent applications relate to digital wireless communications technologies, including patents that are essential or may be important to the commercial implementation of CDMA2000, WCDMA (UMTS), TD-SCDMA, TD-CDMA (Time Division CDMA), OFDMA-based LTE and OFDMA-based 5G products. Our patent portfolio is the most widely and extensively licensed in the industry, with more than 300 licensees. Additionally, we have a substantial patent portfolio related to key technologies used in communications and other devices and\/or related services, some of which were developed in industry standards development bodies. These include certain video codecs, audio codecs, Wi-Fi, memory interfaces, wireless power, GPS and positioning, broadcast and streaming protocols, and short-range communication functionalities, including NFC and Bluetooth. Our patents cover a wide range of technologies across the entire wireless system, including the device (handsets and other wireless devices), not just the portion of such patented technologies incorporated into chipsets, and the network. Over the years, a number of companies have challenged our patent position, but companies in the mobile communications industry generally recognize that any company seeking to develop, manufacture and\/or sell certain wireless products that use CDMA-based and\/or OFDMA-based technologies will require a license or other rights to use our patents. We have licensed or otherwise provided rights to use our patents to hundreds of companies on industry-accepted terms. Unlike some other companies in our industry that hold back certain key technologies, we offer companies substantially our entire patent portfolio for use in cellular devices and cell site infrastructure equipment. Our strategy to make our patented technologies broadly available has been a catalyst for industry growth, helping to enable a wide range of companies offering a broad array of wireless products and features while increasing the capabilities of and\/or driving down average and low-end selling prices for 3G and 3G\/4G multimode handsets and other wireless devices. By licensing or otherwise providing rights to use our patents to a wide range of equipment manufacturers, encouraging innovative applications, supporting equipment manufacturers with integrated chipset and software products and focusing on improving the efficiency of the airlink for wireless operators, we have helped 3G and 3G\/4G multimode evolve and grow and reduce device pricing. 5G network deployments and commercial 3G\/4G\/5G multimode device sales began in 2019 and continued throughout 2020. By licensing or otherwise providing rights to use our patents to a wide range of equipment manufacturers, 5G will continue to encourage innovative applications through enhanced mobile broadband services with lower latency and multi-gigabit user data speeds and bring more capacity and efficiency to wireless networks. Upon the initial deployment of OFDMA-based networks, the products implementing such technologies generally have been multimode and implement OFDMA-based and CDMA-based technologies. The licenses granted under our existing license agreements generally cover multimode CDMA\/OFDMA (3G\/4G\/5G) devices, and our licensees are obligated to pay royalties under their license agreements for such devices. Standards bodies have been informed that we hold: patents that might be essential for all 3G standards that are based on CDMA; patents and pending patent applications that are potentially essential for LTE standards, including FDD and TDD versions; and patents and pending patent applications that are potentially essential for 5G technologies. We have committed to such standards bodies that we will offer to license our essential patents for these standards consistent with our commitments to those bodies. We have made similar commitments with respect to certain other technologies implemented in industry standards. QTL licensing revenues include royalties and, to a lesser extent, license fees. Licensees pay quarterly royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and may also pay a fixed license fee in one or more installments. Sales-based royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee&#8217;s) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items). We broadly provide per unit royalty caps that apply to certain categories of complete wireless devices, namely smartphones, tablets, laptops and smartwatches, and provide for a maximum royalty amount payable per device. Revenues generated from royalties are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations. The vast majority of QTL revenues have been generated through our licensees&#8217; sales of CDMA2000-based, WCDMA-based and OFDMA-based products (including 3G, 3G\/4G and 3G\/4G\/5G multimode devices), such as smartphones and feature phones. We have invested and continue to invest in both the acquisition and development of OFDMA technology and intellectual property and have generated the industry leading patent portfolio applicable to LTE, LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro and 5G-NR. Some of our inventions that serve as foundational technologies for 3G and 4G also serve as foundational technologies for 5G. We have invested and continue to invest in the development of 5G and continue to play a significant role in driving advancements of 5G. Nevertheless, we face competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of digital wireless communications technologies and services. Separate and apart from licensing manufacturers of wireless devices and network equipment, we have entered into certain arrangements with competitors of our QCT segment. A principal purpose of these arrangements is to provide our QCT segment and the counterparties certain freedom of operation with respect to each party&#8217;s integrated circuits business. In every case, these agreements expressly reserve the right for QTL to seek royalties from the customers of such integrated circuit suppliers with respect to such suppliers&#8217; customers&#8217; sales of CDMA-, WCDMA- and OFDMA-based wireless devices into which such suppliers&#8217; integrated circuits are incorporated. Our license agreements also may provide us with rights to use certain of our licensees&#8217; technology and intellectual property to manufacture, sell and\/or use certain components (e.g., application-specific integrated circuits) and related software, cellular devices and\/or infrastructure equipment. We are currently subject to certain governmental investigations and private legal proceedings challenging our patent licensing practices, including those described in this Annual Report under the heading &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies,&#8221; which may require us to change our patent licensing practices as described more fully herein in &#8220;Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; under the heading &#8220; Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations or private legal proceedings challenging those practices, or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. &#8221; QSI Segment. QSI makes strategic investments primarily through our Qualcomm Ventures arm that are focused on expanding or opening new opportunities for our technologies as well as supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services). Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries and applications, including, but not limited to, artificial intelligence, automotive, digital healthcare, enterprise, IoT, mobile and networking. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity securities and to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities (the majority of which resulted from initial public offerings of certain non-marketable equity investments) and convertible debt instruments. In addition, QSI segment results include revenues and related costs associated with development contracts with one of our investees (OneWeb). As part of our strategic investment activities, we intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future. Other Businesses. Nonreportable segments include our Qualcomm Government Technologies or QGOV business, our cloud AI inference processing initiative and other technology and service initiatives. QGOV provides development and other services and sells related products to U.S. government agencies and their contractors. Additional information regarding our operating segments is provided in this Annual Report in &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8.

(Oppo) and BBK Communication Technology Co., Ltd. (vivo), and their respective affiliates (including BBK), Samsung and Xiaomi each comprised 10% or more of consolidated revenues. Revenues from Huawei also comprised 10% or more of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2020, which were positively impacted by the settlement of our prior dispute. Revenues in fiscal 2018 were negatively impacted by our prior dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers. Additional information regarding the settlements is provided in this Annual Report in &#8220;Part II, Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; Research and Development The wireless communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and, with the introduction of 5G, the expansion into new industry segments or applications such as automotive and IoT, requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and technologies and to develop new products and technologies. We have significant engineering resources, including engineers with substantial expertise in CDMA, OFDMA and a broad range of other technologies. Using these engineering resources, we expect to continue to invest in research and development in a variety of ways in an effort to extend the demand for our products, and to utilize that research and development in adjacent industry segments or applications beyond mobile (such as automotive and IoT), including continuing the development of CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies (such as RFFE), developing alternative technologies for certain specialized applications, participating in the formulation of new voice and data communication standards and technologies, and assisting in deploying digital voice and data communications networks around the world. Our research and development team has a demonstrated track record of innovation in voice and data communication technologies and application processor technology, among others. We continue to invest significant resources towards advancements in OFDMA-based technologies and products (including LTE and 5G). We also engage in acquisitions and other transactions, such as joint ventures, to meet certain technology needs, to obtain development resources or open or expand opportunities for our technologies and to support the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products and services) for voice and data communications and new industry segments or applications beyond mobile. We make investments to provide our integrated circuit customers with chipsets designed on leading-edge technology nodes that combine multiple technologies for use in consumer electronic devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops, AR\/VR\/XR devices) and other products (e.g., access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment). In addition to 3G, 4G and 5G technologies, our chipsets support other wireless and wired connectivity technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, location positioning and Powerline communication. Our integrated chipsets often include multiple technologies, including advanced multimode modems, application processors and graphics engines, as well as the tools to connect these diverse technologies. We continue to support Android, Windows and other client software environments in our chipsets. We develop on our own, and with our partners, innovations that are integrated into our product portfolio to further expand the opportunity for wireless communications and enhance the value of our products and services. These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of their existing services, offer these services more affordably and introduce revenue-generating broadband data services ahead of their competition. We have research and development centers in various locations throughout the world that support our global development activities and ongoing efforts to develop and\/or advance 4G, 5G and a broad range of other technologies. We continue to use our substantial engineering resources and expertise to develop new technologies, applications and services and make them available to licensees to help grow the communications industry and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing activities of our operating segments are discussed under Operating Segments. Other marketing activities include public relations, branding, digital marketing and social media, technical marketing, product marketing, participation in technical conferences and trade shows, development of use cases and white papers, competitive analyses and industry intelligence and other marketing programs, such as co-marketing with our customers or licensees. Our Corporate Marketing department provides information on our company website and through other channels regarding our products, strategies and technology to investors, industry analysts, media, prospective job applicants, consumers and others. Competition Competition faced by our operating segments is discussed under Operating Segments. Competition in the wireless communications industry throughout the world continues to increase at a rapid pace as consumers, businesses and governments realize the potential of wireless communications products and services. We expect competition to increase as our current competitors expand their product offerings and introduce new technologies and services in the future and as additional companies compete with our products and\/or services based on 3G, 4G, 5G and\/or other technologies. Although we intend to continue to make substantial investments in developing new products and technologies and improving existing products and technologies to strengthen and\/or maintain our competitive position, our competitors may introduce alternative products, services or technologies that threaten our business. It is also possible that the prices we charge for our products and services may continue to decline as competition continues to intensify. See also the Risk Factor entitled &#8220; Our industry is subject to intense competition in an environment of rapid technological change. Our success depends in part on our ability to adapt to such change and compete effectively; and such change and competition could result in decreased demand for our products and technologies or declining average selling prices for our products or those of our customers or licensees.&#8221; Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital For decades, our innovations have helped transform industries, enhance the lives of billions of people and address some of society&#8217;s biggest challenges. With the world becoming increasingly connected, we have a tremendous opportunity to shape a better future. We believe in the power of technology. As such, our corporate responsibility vision is to be a facilitator of innovation for a sustainable world, connected wirelessly. ESG Our sustained investment in R&#38;D has helped revolutionize the way people connect; our approach to innovation is strategic and purposeful. We understand that the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our world. We focus our efforts in four key areas where we believe we can have the biggest impact: &#8226; Responsible Business. We integrate responsible and sustainable practices throughout our organization. Our products are designed to not harm individuals, communities or the environment. We continually look for ways to conserve water, minimize energy consumption, lower emissions and reduce waste. Because privacy and security are critical for success in the wireless industry, we constantly seek to promote data protection across the mobile ecosystem. &#8226; Our People.

We also work to broaden our impact by bringing advanced wireless technologies to underserved communities around the world. In doing so, we believe that we have enriched the lives of millions of people while creating new opportunities for our business. &#8226; STEM Education. We seek to inspire the next generation of inventors and advance workforce development for STEM-related careers (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Our initiatives are designed to promote and improve STEM education at all levels and to expand opportunities for underrepresented students. We encourage you to review our March 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report (located on our Internet site at www.qualcomm.com) for more detailed information regarding our ESG programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website, including our Corporate Responsibility Report or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. Human Capital In order to continue to produce the innovative, breakthrough technologies for which we are known, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top talent. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Qualcomm a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities. At September 27, 2020, we had approximately 41,000 full-time, part-time and temporary employees, the overwhelming majority of which were full-time employees. During fiscal 2020, the number of employees increased by approximately 4,000, primarily due to increases in engineering resources. Our employees are represented by more than 100 self-identified nationalities working in over 150 locations in 32 different countries around the world. Collectively, we speak more than 60 different languages. Our global workforce is highly educated, with the substantial majority of our employees working in engineering or technical roles (many of whom help develop foundational technologies for both our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business). During fiscal 2020, our voluntary turnover rate was less than 5%, below the technology industry benchmark, which is comprised of certain of our key competitors (Aon, 2020 Salary Increase and Turnover Study &#8212; Second Edition, September 2020). Diversity and Inclusion. We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we continue to focus on the hiring, retention and advancement of women and underrepresented populations. Our recent efforts have been focused in three areas: inspiring innovation through an inclusive and diverse culture; expanding our efforts to recruit and hire world-class diverse talent; and identifying strategic partners to accelerate our inclusion and diversity programs. We have a number of employee networks that enhance our inclusive and diverse culture, including those supporting Women, Africans and African Americans, Latinos, Veterans, the LGBTQ+ community and employees with disabilities. We continue to recruit technical talent in diverse communities, including by engaging as a high-level sponsor of professional conferences, such as the Grace Hopper Celebration, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers National Convention and the National Society of Black Engineers National Convention. We also continue to recruit from a variety of colleges including Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Women&#8217;s Colleges. Our continued engagement with organizations that work with diverse communities has been vital to our efforts to increase women and minority representation in our workforce. For example, we partner with AnitaB.org to benchmark our progress and identify promising practices for recruiting, retaining and advancing women technologists and support its research initiatives related to attracting and retaining women and underrepresented minority students in computing majors. We, alongside other top technology companies, helped form the Reboot Representation Tech Coalition, which aims to double the number of Black, Latinx and Native American women receiving computing degrees by 2025. In collaboration with the National Foundation for Autism Research, we started an internship program to welcome those with autism into our Company. Through our collaboration with Disability:IN&#8217;s Inclusion Works program, we have increased our ability to address the needs of individuals with disabilities. In an effort to provide additional transparency into our efforts to increase underrepresented populations in our workforce, we intend to disclose our 2020 Consolidated EEO-1 Report after our submission of the report to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. From a governance perspective, our HR and Compensation Committee, through its charter, provides oversight of our policies, programs and initiatives focusing on workforce diversity and inclusion. Health, Safety and Wellness. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. Compensation and Benefits. We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country\/region) include annual bonuses, stock awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, adoption and surrogacy assistance, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance and on-site services, such as health centers and fitness centers, among many others. In addition to our broad-based equity award programs, we have used targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly those with critical engineering skills and experience. Talent Development. We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain a world-leading wireless innovator. We deliver numerous training opportunities, provide rotational assignment opportunities, have expanded our focus on continuous learning and development, and implemented &#8220;industry-leading&#8221; methodologies to manage performance, provide feedback and develop talent. Our talent development programs provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals, build management skills and lead their organizations. We provide a series of employee workshops around the globe that support professional growth and development. Additionally, our manager and employee forum programs provide an ongoing opportunity for employees to practice and apply learning around conversations aligned with our annual review process. We also have an employee development website that provides quick access to learning resources that are personalized to the individual's development needs. Building Connections &#8212; With Each Other and our Communities. We believe that building connections between our employees, their families and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. Through our engagement programs, our employees can pursue their interests and hobbies, connect to volunteering and giving opportunities and enjoy unique recreational experiences with family members. Leveraging our partnerships with various local arts and culture organizations, we have created numerous unique experiences for employees and their families around the world. Since our employees are passionate about many causes, our corporate giving and volunteering programs support and encourage employees by engaging with those causes. In our offices around the world, our employee-led Giving Committees select local organizations to support, often in the form of grants that are primarily funded by the Qualcomm Foundation (which was established in 2011 to support charitable giving and volunteerism). We also frequently collaborate with these organizations on volunteer activities for our employees. Additionally, during fiscal 2020, thousands of our employees around the world utilized our charitable match program, benefiting more than 1,500 charitable organizations. We encourage you to review the &#8220;Our People&#8221; section of our March 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report (located on our website) for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives.

BusinessOverviewWe are an early stage blank check company incorporated on September 1, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination. We intend to focus our search for a target business at the intersection of the healthcare and technology industries. &#160; Significant Activities Since InceptionOn October 29, 2020, the Company consummated its initial public offering of 34,500,000, including 4,500,000 additional units to cover over-allotments. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (&#8220;Class A common stock&#8221;), and one-third of one warrant, each whole warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $345,000,000. Simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering and the sale of the units, the Company consummated the private placement (&#8220;private placement&#8221;) of an aggregate of 5,933,333 warrants to our sponsor at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, generating total proceeds of $8,900,000.A total of $345 million of the net proceeds from our initial public offering (including the over-allotment) and the private placement with the sponsor were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company&#8217;s public stockholders.Our units began trading on October 22, 2020 on the Nasdaq under the symbol &#8220; LUXAU&#8221; . On December 11, 2020, the securities comprising the units began separate trading. The common stock and warrants trade on Nasdaq under the symbols &#8220; LUXA &#8221; and &#8220; LUXAW ,&#8221; respectively.Acquisition CriteriaOur acquisition strategy is to complete a business combination that will create value for our shareholders over time. We plan to identify a high-quality private company at the cutting edge of healthcare (including those focused on, but not limited to devices, diagnostics, information technology, and supplies utilized in hospital, physician office, home health, personal health, nursing, and other healthcare environments) and technology (including, but not limited to artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, automation, biomaterials, connected devices and internet of things, data sciences, imaging, nanotechnology, and three-dimensional printing). We will be guided by the desire to solve important, consequential, and valuable problems, and will focus on three types of opportunities:&#160;&#8226; Thesis driven. Variant perception, scientific breakthroughs, and emerging trends. &#160;&#8226; People driven. Serial entrepreneurs, acclaimed scientists, and trusted partners. &#160;&#8226; Special situations. Sector dislocations and corporate spin-offs. These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.&#160;&#160;Our Sponsor and Competitive Advantages Our sponsor is Lux Encore Sponsor, LP, a Delaware limited partnership indirectly owned primarily by Lux Ventures Partners VI, LLC. We refer to Lux Ventures Partners VI, LLC together with its affiliates as &#8220;Lux.&#8221; Lux is a leading venture capital firm, based in New York and Silicon Valley, with more than $2.4 billion under management. The firm invests in emerging science and technology ventures.Lux has a 20-year investment track record, with more than 130 active investments. Some of Lux&#8217;s prior investments in the private market include: Auris Health (flexible and surgical robotic intervention), which was acquired by Johnson &#38; Johnson for up to $5.75 billion, including consideration of milestone payments; CTRL-Labs (wearables technology and neuroscience), which was acquired by Facebook; Recursion (machine learning, robotics, and drug discovery); Avail Medsystems (telepresence, remote collaboration, and medical technology); Kallyope (sequencing, bioinformatics, neural imaging, molecular biology, and human genetics); Science 37 (digital technologies and clinical trials); and Strateos (robotics, automation, and life sciences).These investments and others have allowed Lux to gain access to the highest quality management teams and acquisition opportunities, which we believe will be important in identifying potential business combination targets. Our management team believes that its market reputation and experience, proactive approach to sourcing transactions and extensive network of relationships at the intersection of healthcare and technology will provide a substantial number of proprietary business combination opportunities. The network of our management team has grown through their activities in sourcing, financing, merging and acquiring businesses, developing relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. Our management team&#8217;s research-oriented, data-intensive process has historically resulted in proactively identifying trends, finding opportunities, including opportunities that may not be broadly marketed, and executing transactions ahead of potential competitors.Our management team also believes that its sector expertise and broad network of relationships will allow it to add significant value to the combined business following an initial business combination. We expect to assist the post-business combination entity in continuing its growth trajectory for many years to come. We expect to collaborate with management on a number of initiatives, including, but not limited to, active Board participation, strategic and capital markets advice and recruitment of talent. We believe our track record of success and support of management teams will make us a partner of choice for high-quality healthcare and technology businesses.Our Management Team and Board of DirectorsOur management team and Board is led by Peter H&#233;bert, our Chairman. Josh DeFonzo serves as our Chief Executive Officer, and a member of our Board. Segolene Scarborough serves as our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Dr. Bijan Salehizadeh, Senator Joseph Robert &#8220;Bob&#8221; Kerrey and Dr. Fred Moll serve on our Board.Mr. Peter H&#233;bert is a co-founder and managing partner of Lux and oversees Lux&#8217;s investments at the intersection of technology and medical devices, including Auris Health, which was acquired by Johnson &#38; Johnson, and Avail Medsystems.Mr. Josh DeFonzo is a former President at Johnson &#38; Johnson (Robotics &#38; Digital Solutions), the former Chief Operating Officer of Auris Health, and a former Chief Commercial Officer of CareDx (NASDAQ: CDNA).Ms. Segolene Scarborough is the Chief Financial Officer at Lux Capital, a former controller at Sequoia Capital, and a former senior manager at Pricewaterhouse Coopers.Dr. Bijan Salehizadeh is an experienced investor in medical technology and the co-founder and managing director of healthcare private equity firm NaviMed Capital. He is a former general partner of Highland Capital Partners, a former executive of Medtronic and a former member of the boards of directors of Auris Health and Hyperion Therapeutics, which was acquired by Horizon Therapeutics.&#160;&#160;Senator Joseph Robert &#8220;Bob&#8221; Kerrey is a managing director of the investment banking firm Allen &#38; Company, past President of the New School and has served as U.S. Senator from Nebraska and as Governor of Nebraska. Senator Kerrey is also the lead director of Tenet Healthcare Corporation and is a board member of three private companies: Imagen, Intarcia, and Monolith Energy. He is also a former member of the board of directors of Auris Health. Dr. Fred Moll is an experienced executive in the medical technology industry, and was the co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Auris Health prior to the company being acquired by Johnson &#38; Johnson. He is currently Chief Development Officer for Johnson &#38; Johnson Medical Device Companies. He is the co-founder of several companies, including Hansen Medical, Intuitive Surgical, Endo-Therapeutics, and Origin. MedSystems. Dr. Moll currently serves on the board of directors of IntersectENT and Shockwave Medical.Our management team&#8217;s and Board&#8217;s efforts to source, diligence and negotiate an initial business combination will be supported by Lux&#8217;s ten-person investment team, which has a wide range of interdisciplinary technical, strategic and financial skills.Members of our management team and Board are not required to commit any specific amount of time to our affairs, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any member of our management team will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. Accordingly, our officers and directors may have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.Initial Business CombinationIn accordance with Nasdaq listing rules, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80% of fair market value test. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our Board based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and\/or book value). Even though our Board will rely on generally accepted standards, our Board will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the Board in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of our satisfaction of the 80% of fair market value test, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our Board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our Board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the Board is less familiar or experienced with the target company&#8217;s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target company&#8217;s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the Board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of fair market value test, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our stockholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to stockholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion. &#160;&#160;We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the prior owners of the target business, the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of fair market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us.The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.Our Acquisition ProcessIn evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal, regulatory and other information which will be made available to us.We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view from either an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm.&#160;&#160;Members of our management team may directly or indirectly own our common stock and\/or private placement warrants, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Delaware law. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to identify and pursue business combination opportunities or to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any business combination opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis.We currently do not have any specific business combination under consideration. Our officers and directors have neither individually identified nor considered a target business, nor have they had any discussions regarding possible target businesses among themselves or with our underwriters or other advisors. Lux is continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination, but we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) contacted any prospective target business or had any substantive discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to a business combination transaction with our company. We have not (nor have any of our agents or affiliates) been approached by any candidates (or representative of any candidates) with respect to a possible acquisition transaction with our company and we will not consider a business combination with any company that has already been identified to Lux as a suitable acquisition candidate for it, unless Lux, in its sole discretion, declines such potential business combination or makes available to our company a co-investment opportunity. Additionally, we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, taken any substantive measure, directly or indirectly, to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate for us, nor have we engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any such acquisition candidate.Status as a Public CompanyWe believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for our Class A common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters&#8217; ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders&#8217; interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company&#8217;s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.&#160;&#160;While we believe that our structure and our management team&#8217;s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively. We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to SEC rules from time to time), or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.Additionally, we are a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221; as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of any fiscal year for so long as either (1) the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates did not equal or exceed $250.0 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues did not exceed $100.0 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates did not equal or exceed $700.0 million as of the prior June 30.Effecting our Initial Business CombinationWe intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering, the private placements of the private placement warrants and the forward private purchase securities, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.&#160;&#160;We currently do not have any specific business combination under consideration. Our officers and directors have neither individually selected nor considered a target business, nor have they had any discussions regarding possible target businesses among themselves or with our underwriters or other advisors. Some of the members of our management team are employed by certain affiliates of Lux. Lux is continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination, but we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) contacted any prospective target business or had any discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to a business combination transaction. We have not (nor have any of our agents or affiliates) been approached by any candidates (or representative of any candidates) with respect to a possible acquisition transaction with us and we will not consider a business combination with any company that has already been identified to Lux as a suitable acquisition candidate for it. Additionally, we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, taken any measure, directly or indirectly, to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate for us, nor have we engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any such acquisition candidate. We have not selected any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions with any business combination target. Additionally, we have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate, to conduct any research or take any measures, directly or indirectly, to locate or contact a target business, other than our officers and directors. Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business.We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account, or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.Sources of Target BusinessesOur process of identifying acquisition targets will leverage Lux, our sponsor and our management team&#8217;s industry experiences, proven deal sourcing capabilities and broad and deep network of relationships in numerous industries, including executives and management teams, private equity groups and other institutional investors, large business enterprises, lenders, investment bankers and other investment market participants, restructuring advisers, consultants, attorneys and accountants, which we believe should provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. We expect that the collective experience, capability and network of our sponsor, Lux, our directors and officers, combined with their individual and collective reputations in the investment community, will help to create prospective business combination opportunities.In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and private investment funds. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our public filings and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their respective affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions.&#160;&#160;We also expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder&#8217;s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm&#8217;s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder&#8217;s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder&#8217;s fee, consulting fee or other compensation by the company prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). None of our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder&#8217;s fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated acquisition of such target by us. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors or from making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm, that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including entities that are affiliates of our sponsor, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Delaware law. Lack of Business DiversificationFor an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: &#160; &#160;&#8226; subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we may operate after our initial business combination; and &#160;&#8226; cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. &#160; Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target&#8217;s Management TeamAlthough we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business&#8217;s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.&#160;&#160;We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business CombinationWe may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons.Under Nasdaq&#8217;s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:&#160;&#8226; we issue shares of common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our shares of common stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering); &#160;&#8226; any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by the Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common stock or voting power of 5% or more; or &#160;&#8226; the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control. &#160;&#8226; The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which stockholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: &#160;&#8226; the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company; &#160;&#8226; the expected cost of holding a stockholder vote; &#160;&#8226; the risk that the stockholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination; &#160;&#8226; other time and budget constraints of the company; and &#160;&#8226; additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to stockholders. Permitted Purchases of Our SecuritiesIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their respective affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.&#160;&#160;Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgment that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their respective affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.In addition, if such purchases are made, the public &#8220;float&#8221; of our Class A common stock or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.Our sponsor, officers, directors and\/or their respective affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their respective affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders (in the case of our Class A common stock) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their respective affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the stockholder meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their respective affiliates will select which stockholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and\/or their respective affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and\/or their respective affiliates will not make purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business CombinationWe will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the completion of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be &#160;&#160;reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our sponsor, directors and each member of our management have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with ( i ) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not completed an initial business combination by October 29, 2022. &#160; Manner of Conducting RedemptionsWe will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking stockholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our shares of outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote unless stockholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq rules.If we held a stockholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:&#160;&#8226; conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and &#160;&#8226; file proxy materials with the SEC. &#160; In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holder present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, our sponsor and members of our management team have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering, in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders&#8217; founder shares, we would need 12,937,501, or 37.5% (assuming all issued and outstanding shares are voted), or 2,156,251, or 6.25% (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted), of the 34,500,000 public shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will complete our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a stockholder on the &#160;&#160;record date for the stockholder meeting held to approve the proposed transaction. In addition, our sponsor, directors and each member of our management, have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with ( i ) the completion of a business combination and (ii) a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not completed an initial business combination by October 29, 2022. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: &#160; &#160;&#8226; conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and &#160;&#8226; file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of our Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of our Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder ApprovalNotwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a &#8220;group&#8221; (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to the Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding &#160;&#160;more than an aggregate of 15% of our shares could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder&#8217;s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders&#8217; ability to redeem no more than 15% of our shares without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders&#8217; ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. &#160; Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption RightsPublic stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in &#8220;street name,&#8221; will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company&#8217;s DWAC (Deposit\/ Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder&#8217;s option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the initial business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the initial vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders&#8217; vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the initial business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an &#8220;option window&#8221; after the completion of the initial business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company&#8217;s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become &#8220;option&#8221; rights surviving past the completion of the initial business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming stockholder&#8217;s election to redeem is irrevocable once the initial business combination is approved.Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.&#160;&#160;If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until October 29, 2022.Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business CombinationOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only until October 29, 2022 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination by October 29, 2022, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes as well as expenses relating to the administration of the trust account (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#8217; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time period.Our sponsor, directors and each member of our management have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we do not complete an initial business combination by October 29, 2022. However, our sponsor, directors or members of our management team will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination within the prescribed time period.Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination by October 29, 2022, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes as well as expenses relating to the administration of the trust account (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $1,000,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account plus up to $100,000 of funds from the trust account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.&#160;&#160;If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, the sale of the private placement warrants and the sale of the forward purchase securities, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors&#8217; claims. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party&#8217;s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver.In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per share, due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, if any, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor&#8217;s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per share, due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, if any, and our sponsor asserts that they are unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per share.&#160;&#160;We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately $1,000,000 from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such stockholder. Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by October 29, 2022 may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&#8217;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by October 29, 2022, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we do not complete our initial business combination by October 29, 2022, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our taxes as well as expenses relating to the administration of the trust account (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#8217; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following October 29, 2022 and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust &#160;&#160;account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below ( i ) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. If we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor\/creditor and\/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a &#8220;preferential transfer&#8221; or a &#8220;fraudulent conveyance.&#8221; As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our Board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and\/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination by October 29, 2022, subject to applicable law, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination by October 29, 2022 or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Public stockholders who redeem their shares of our Class A common stock in connection with a stockholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not completed an initial business combination by October 29, 2022, with respect to such shares of our Class A common stock so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder&#8217;s voting in connection with the initial business combination alone will not result in a stockholder&#8217;s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote.CompetitionIn identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.&#160;&#160;Employees We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in.Periodic Reporting and Financial InformationWe have registered our units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at: http:\/\/www.sec.gov. Our annual, quarterly and current reports, and any amendments to any of those reports, that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable through our corporate website address at www.luxhealth.tech. The contents of these websites are not incorporated into this filing. Further, our references to the uniform resource locators, or URLs, for these websites are intended to be inactive textual references only.We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.&#160;&#160;","24":" Item 1. Business. &#160; &#160; Overview &#160; Sportsman&#8217;s Warehouse is an outdoor sporting goods retailer focused on meeting the everyday needs of the seasoned outdoor veteran, the first-time participant, and everyone in between. Our mission is to provide outstanding gear and exceptional service to inspire outdoor memories . We strive to accomplish this goal by tailoring our broad and deep merchandise assortment to meet local conditions and demand, offering everyday low prices, providing friendly support from our knowledgeable and highly trained staff, and offering a top-tier e-commerce experience, extensive in-store events and educational programming. These core strategies help position Sportsman&#8217;s Warehouse as the &#8220;local outdoor experts&#8221; and the preferred place to not only shop, but to also share outdoor-based experiences in the communities we serve. As a result, we are growing our loyal customer base in existing markets, expanding our footprint into new markets, and increasing our omni-channel presence in both new and existing markets, which we believe will further drive our growth and profitability. &#160; Sportsman&#8217;s Warehouse was founded in 1986 as a single retail store in Midvale, Utah and has grown to 103 stores across 27 states. Today, we have the largest outdoor specialty store base in the Western United States and Alaska. Our stores range from 7,500 to 65,000 gross square feet, with an average size of approximately 40,000 gross square feet. Our store layout is adaptable to both standalone locations and strip centers. We believe it is less capital-intensive for us to open new stores compared to our principal competitors because our &#8220;no frills&#8221; store layout requires less initial cash investment to build out and our stores generally require less square footage than the stores of our competitors. We also have the largest offering of firearms available online for in-store purchase and buy-online-pickup-in-store when compared to the offerings of our major competitors. Together, these features and capabilities enable us to effectively serve markets of multiple sizes, from Metropolitan Statistical Areas (&#8220;MSAs&#8221;) with populations of less than 75,000 to major metropolitan areas with populations in excess of 1,000,000, while generating consistent four-wall adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#8220;Adjusted EBITDA&#8221;) margins and returns on invested capital across a range of store sales volumes. We may post information that is important to investors on our website from time to time. The information provided on our website is not part of this report and is, therefore, not incorporated herein by reference. &#160; Our Competitive Strengths &#160; We believe the following competitive strengths allow us to capitalize on the growth opportunity within the outdoor activities and sporting goods market: &#160; Differentiated Shopping Experience for the Seasoned Outdoor Veteran, the First-Time Participant and Everyone in Between. We place great emphasis on creating an inviting and engaging store experience for customers of all experience levels. For the seasoned outdoor veteran, we offer a one-stop, convenient store layout that promotes &#8220;easy-in, easy-out&#8221; access to replenish supplies, learn about local conditions and test products. We also serve first-time participants and casual users who are interested in enjoying the outdoors but enter our store without a clear sense for the equipment needed for their chosen activity. Our highly trained employees, who often are local outdoor enthusiasts and users of the products we sell, engage and interact with our customers in order to educate them and equip them with the right gear. Our sales associates draw upon formal vendor sales training as well as first-hand experiences from using our products in local conditions. This selling approach allows us to offer a broad range of products and to deliver a shopping experience centered on the customer&#8217;s needs, which we believe results in increased customer loyalty, repeat visits and frequent referrals to other potential customers. &#160; A customer&#8217;s shopping experience in our stores is further enhanced by a variety of helpful in-store offerings and features, including access to hunting and fishing licenses, local fishing reports, Sportsman&#8217;s News (our proprietary in-store newspaper), the Braggin&#8217; Board (where customers can post photos of their outdoor adventures), indoor test ranges for archery equipment and displays of customer-owned taxidermy. In addition, we host a variety of in-store programs (such as ladies&#8217; night), contests (such as Bucks &#38; Bulls, a free-to-enter big-game trophy contest) and a wide range of instructional seminars (such as turkey frying and firearm operation and safety). These programs are all designed to help our customers connect with the outdoors and build the skills necessary to maximize enjoyment of their chosen activities. As a result, we believe our stores often serve as gathering spots where local enthusiasts can share stories, product knowledge and advice on outdoor recreation activities, which drives traffic and fosters customer loyalty. &#160; Our in-store experience is further complimented by our top-tier e-commerce experience available on our website, sportsmans.com. We also offer the ability for our customers to buy our product on-line and pick up their order in any of our stores. &#160; Locally Relevant Merchandise Serving the Comprehensive Needs of Outdoor Enthusiasts at a Compelling Value . We offer our customers an extensive and carefully selected assortment of branded, high-quality outdoor products at competitive prices. We accomplish this primarily in three ways: &#160; &#183; Locally Relevant Merchandise : We carry over 46,000 SKUs on average in a single store, out of Sportsman&#8217;s total of approximately 138,000 SKUs. Each store&#8217;s merchandise is tailored to meet local conditions and consumer demand, which takes into account seasonal and weather requirements, regional game and fishing species and key demographic factors, so that our customers have access to the appropriate product at the right time for their geography. &#160; &#183; Breadth and Mix of Product Assortment : Our merchandise strategy is designed to serve a variety of purchasing occasions and user experience levels, from big-ticket items to consumables, and from first-time participants to seasoned outdoor veterans. We pride ourselves on carrying an extensive selection of branded good, better and best hard goods at everyday low prices. Approximately 37% of our unit sales and 19% of our dollar sales during fiscal year 2019 were consumables, such as ammunition, bait, cleaning supplies, food, certain lures, propane and reloading supplies. We believe our broad array of in-stock consumable goods appeals to a broad range of customers and drives repeat traffic as well as increased average ticket value. &#160; &#183; Strong Vendor Relationships : We believe our vendors find our brand-centric, high-service store concept to be unique among national specialty outdoor retailers. Our attractive store locations, consistent presentation of merchandise and thorough product training present a compelling opportunity for our vendors to offer their brands to local markets. As a result, we believe we are able to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors that are similar to those offered to our principal competitors that are larger in size. We share the benefits of these strategic vendor relationships with our customers through everyday low prices, enhanced access to certain products that are limited in production and special make-up products sold exclusively at Sportsman&#8217;s Warehouse &#160; Flexible and Adaptable Real Estate Strategy . We believe that our store model, combined with our rigorous site selection process, is a competitive advantage that enables us to better address the needs of markets of varying sizes and geographies. Our stores vary in size from approximately 7,500 to 65,000 gross square feet. We have had success with leasing existing sites, constructing new build-to-suit sites and purchasing existing stores and converting them to the Sportsman&#8217;s brand. Our flexible store model permits us to serve both large metropolitan areas, like Phoenix, Arizona, and smaller MSAs, like Soldotna, Alaska, while generating consistent four-wall Adjusted EBITDA margins and returns on invested capital across a range of store sales volumes. In small- to medium-sized markets, we are often able to establish ourselves as a standalone destination for our customers; in larger markets, we have successfully leveraged existing infrastructure to open stores in shopping plazas near complementary retailers, drawing upon existing foot traffic. We believe our low-cost, flexible model allows us to access both large and small markets more economically than many of our peers. &#160; We maintain a disciplined approach to new store development and perform comprehensive market research before selecting a new site, including partnering with specialized, third-party local real estate firms. We select sites based on criteria such as local demographics, traffic patterns, density of hunting and fishing license holders in the area, abundance of hunting and fishing game and outdoor recreation activities, store visibility and accessibility, purchase data from our existing customer database and availability of attractive lease terms. We have established productive relationships with well-regarded commercial real estate firms and believe that we are a sought-after tenant, given the strength of the Sportsman&#8217;s Warehouse brand, the high volume of customers that visit our stores and our strong financial performance since becoming a public company. As a result, we continue to have access to desirable retail sites on attractive terms. &#160; Low Cost Operating Structure with Attractive and Replicable Store Economics . We strive to maintain a lower operating cost structure than many of our key competitors, which allows us to serve small- to medium-sized markets as well as larger MSAs. We achieve this through discipline and financial rigor around store-level expenses, real estate costs and corporate overhead. In addition, we utilize efficient, localized marketing campaigns and our &#8220;no frills&#8221; warehouse store layout helps us maintain comparatively low operating costs and provides us with the opportunity to achieve four-wall Adjusted EBITDA margins of 10% or more for stores in most new markets. Our typical new store requires an average net investment of approximately $2.0 million, which includes store build-out (net of contributions from landlords) and pre-opening cash expenditures. In addition, we stock each new store with initial inventory at an average cost of approximately $2.2 million. We target a pre-tax return on invested capital within one year after opening of over 50% excluding initial inventory cost (or over 20% including initial inventory cost), although our historical returns have often exceeded these thresholds. As of the end of fiscal year 2019, the majority of our stores that had been open for more than twelve months were profitable and those stores had an average four-wall Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.0%. We believe this low-cost, capital-efficient approach also allows us to successfully serve markets that are not well-suited for the more capital-intensive store models of our key competitors. Approximately 59% of our markets currently lack another nationally recognized outdoor specialty retailer, which we believe is a result of these dynamics. &#160; Significant New Store Growth Opportunity within Existing and New Markets . As of February 1, 2020, we operated 103 stores across 27 states, primarily in the Western United States and Alaska, with a presence in these markets that is nearly three times that of the next largest outdoor retailer. We believe our leadership position in the Western United States, combined with our existing scalable infrastructure, provides a strong foundation for continued expansion within our core markets as well as expanding into new geographies. &#160; &#160; Passionate and Experienced Management Team with Proven Track Record . We are focused on delivering an unsurpassed shopping experience to anyone who enjoys the excitement of the outdoors. This passion and commitment is shared by team members throughout our entire organization, from senior management to the employees in our stores. Our senior management team has an average of nearly 20 years of retail experience, with extensive capabilities across a broad range of disciplines, including merchandising, real estate, finance, compliance, store operations, supply chain management and information technology. We also pride ourselves on the long tenure of our more than 300 store managers and corporate employees, who on average have worked at Sportsman&#8217;s for over seven years &#160; Our Growth Strategy &#160; We are pursuing a number of strategies designed to continue our growth and strong financial performance, including the following: &#160; Growing Our Omni-Channel Presence and Increasing Our Same Store Sales Growth . We are committed to growing our omni-channel presence and increasing same store sales through a number of ongoing and new initiatives, including (i) improving the user experience on our website through continuous category optimization and personalization and product recommendations for online shopping, (ii) expanding our product assortment online (with the assistance of our vendor partners through drop ship and our Federal Firearms License (&#8220;FFL&#8221;) dealer partners), refining our buy online, pick-up in store capabilities, expanding our clothing offerings and private label program (such as our proprietary Rustic Ridge&#8482; and Killik&#8482; clothing lines) and (ii) expanding our online content and expertise through live Q&#38;A and customer reviews and providing exclusive online content, including news, buyer&#8217;s guide, how to&#8217;s and wild game recipes. Each of these ongoing and new initiatives is designed to foster additional shopping convenience, add deeper merchandise selection and provide more product information to the customer. We believe these initiatives have driven and will continue to drive additional traffic, improved conversion and increased average ticket value &#160; Continuing to Enhance Our Operating Margins . We believe that our expansion of our store base and growth in net sales will result in improved Adjusted EBITDA margins as we take advantage of economies of scale in product sourcing and leverage our existing infrastructure, supply chain, corporate overhead and other fixed costs. Furthermore, we expect to increase our gross profit margin by improving vendor terms with key suppliers, increasing sales of used firearms, selling more firearm service plans, expanding product offerings in our private label program, including our proprietary Rustic Ridge TM and Killik TM clothing lines, and continuing marketing initiatives in our higher-margin clothing and footwear departments. However, the gross profit margin gains will likely be partially offset by a negative impact from product mix. Specifically, firearms and ammunition are lower gross profit margin products as compared to other categories in our stores. &#160; Growing the Sportsman&#8217;s Warehouse Brand . We are committed to supporting our stores, product offerings and brand through a variety of marketing programs, private label offerings and corporate partnerships. Our marketing and promotional strategy includes coordinated print, digital and social media platforms. In-store, we offer a wide range of outdoor-themed activities and seminars, from turkey frying to firearm operation and safety. In addition, we sponsor community outreach and charity programs to more broadly connect with our local communities with the aim of promoting our brand and educating consumers. Finally, we are committed to local- and local chapters of national and regional wildlife federations and other outdoor-focused organizations, such as Ducks Unlimited and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation. Many of our store managers and employees serve in senior positions in these organizations, which further strengthens our place as leaders in the local outdoor community. We believe all of these programs promote our mission of engaging with our customers and serving outdoor enthusiasts. &#160; Expanding Our Store Base . We believe that our compelling new store economics and our track record of opening and acquiring successful new stores provide a strong foundation for continued growth through new store openings in existing, adjacent and new markets. Over the last three fiscal years, we have opened an average of nine stores per year, including the eight stores we acquired from Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods in fiscal 2019. We currently plan to open seven to nine new stores in fiscal year 2020. Our target is to grow our square footage at a rate of 4% to 6% percent annually. Our longer-term plans include expanding our store base to serve the outdoor needs of enthusiasts in markets across the United States. We believe our existing infrastructure, including distribution, information technology, loss prevention and employee training, is capable of sustaining 110 or more stores without significant additional capital investment. &#160; Our Stores &#160; We operate 103 stores across 27 states as of February 1, 2020. Most of our stores are located in power, neighborhood and lifestyle centers. Power centers are large, unenclosed shopping centers that are usually anchored by three or more national supercenters, such as Target, Walmart and Costco. Neighborhood centers are shopping centers anchored by a supermarket or drugstore that provide convenience goods and services to a neighborhood. Lifestyle centers are shopping centers that combine the traditional functions of a shopping mall with leisure amenities such as pedestrian friendly areas, open air seating and inviting meeting spaces. We also operate several single-unit, stand-alone locations. Our stores average approximately 40,000 gross square feet. &#160; The following table lists the location by state of our 103 stores open as of February 1, 2020: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Number of Stores &#160; &#160; &#160; Number of Stores Washington &#160; &#160; North Carolina &#160; California &#160; &#160; New York &#160; Utah &#160; &#160; South Carolina &#160; Oregon &#160; &#160; Tennessee &#160; Arizona &#160; &#160; Michigan &#160; Colorado &#160; &#160; Minnesota &#160; Idaho &#160; &#160; Indiana &#160; Alaska &#160; &#160; Iowa &#160; Wyoming &#160; &#160; Kentucky &#160; Nevada &#160; &#160; Louisiana &#160; Pennsylvania &#160; &#160; Mississippi &#160; New Mexico &#160; &#160; North Dakota &#160; Montana &#160; &#160; Virginia &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; West Virginia &#160; &#160; Store Design and Layout &#160; We present our broad and deep array of products in a convenient and engaging atmosphere to meet the everyday needs of all outdoor enthusiasts, from the seasoned veteran to the first-time participant. We maintain a consistent floor layout across our store base that we believe promotes an &#8220;easy-in, easy-out&#8221; shopping experience. All of our stores feature wide aisles, high ceilings, visible signage and central checkouts with multiple registers. Sportsman&#8217;s Warehouse stores, true to their name, are designed in a &#8220;no frills&#8221; warehouse format that welcomes customers directly from or on the way to an outdoor activity. All of our stores also feature &#8220;store-within-a-store&#8221; concepts for certain popular brand partners, such as Yeti, Carhartt, Columbia Sportswear and Under Armour, through which we dedicate a portion of our floor space to these brands to help increase visibility and drive additional sales. The diagram below demonstrates our typical store layout. &#160; &#160; Our stores include locally relevant features such as a large fishing board at the entrance that displays current fishing conditions in local lakes and rivers with coordinating gear in end-cap displays in the fishing aisles. We actively engage our customers through in-store features (such as the &#8220;Braggin&#8217; Board&#8221;), various contests (such as Bucks &#38; Bulls and Fish Alaska), and customer-owned taxidermy displays on the walls. We also host in-store programs (such as ladies&#8217; night) and a wide range of instructional seminars (such as Dutch oven cooking and choosing the right binocular). Annually, we organize approximately 3,000 programs across our stores for the benefit of our customers. We believe these programs help us to connect with the communities in which we operate and encourage new participants to build the skills necessary to become outdoor enthusiasts and loyal customers. &#160; The retail stores and the distribution center have loss prevention employees who monitor an average of 60 cameras at each store and 200 cameras at the distribution center. These cameras are connected to digital video recorders (&#8220;DVRs&#8221;) that record at least 30 days of video. Cameras are monitored locally during store hours. In addition, all cameras are monitored centrally at our headquarters in our dedicated surveillance room, which has the capacity to monitor over 120 stores. This room is staffed continuously and provides off-hours monitoring and backup for all stores. Digital recorded video can be searched by pixel movement, which can quickly identify any loss prevention issue. Our sophisticated systems are a key factor in our shrink rates of less than 1% and an important component of our comprehensive compliance program. &#160; Expansion Opportunities and Site Selection &#160; We have developed a rigorous and flexible process for site selection. We select sites for new store openings based on criteria such as local demographics, traffic patterns, density of hunting and fishing license holders in the area, abundance of hunting and fishing game and outdoor recreation activities, store visibility and accessibility, purchase data from our existing customer database and availability of attractive lease terms. Our store model is adaptable to markets of multiple sizes, from MSAs with populations of less than 75,000 to major metropolitan areas with populations in excess of 1,000,000. We have been successful both in remodeling existing buildings and in constructing new build-to-suit locations. &#160; Our store model is designed to be profitable in a variety of real estate venues, including power, neighborhood and lifestyle centers as well as single-unit, stand-alone locations. In small- to medium-sized markets, we generally seek anchor locations within high-traffic, easily accessible shopping centers. In larger metropolitan areas, we generally seek locations in retail areas with major discount retailers (such as Walmart), wholesale retailers (such as Costco), other specialty hardline retailers (such as The Home Depot) or supermarkets. As we continue to expand our store base, we believe that small- to medium-sized markets offer a significant opportunity. In these markets, we believe our store size, which is smaller than many of our national competitors but larger than many independent retailers, enables us to find convenient, easily accessible store locations while still offering the broad and deep selection of merchandise that our customers desire. In addition, our store format and size allow us to open multiple stores within major MSAs, which gives our customers convenient, easy access to our products without having to travel long distances. &#160; Members of our real estate team spend considerable time and utilize sophisticated tools in evaluating prospective sites before bringing a proposal to our Real Estate Committee. Our Real Estate Committee, which is comprised of members of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Real Estate, and Senior Vice President of Stores, approves all prospective locations before a lease is signed. &#160; We opened or acquired eleven new stores in fiscal year 2019. We currently plan to open an additional seven to nine new stores in fiscal year 2020. Over the long-term our target is to grow our square footage at a rate of 4% to 6% percent annually. Our new store openings are planned in existing, adjacent and new markets. &#160; Our new store growth plan is supported by our target new unit economics, which we believe to be compelling. A typical store location ranges in size from 7,500 to 65,000 gross square feet. Our net investment to open a new store is approximately $2.0 million, consisting of pre-opening expenses and capital investments, net of tenant allowances. In addition, we stock each new store with initial inventory at an average cost of approximately $2.2 million. After the first twelve to eighteen month period after opening a new store, we typically target net sales of $8.0 million to $11.0 million, a four-wall Adjusted EBITDA margin of more than 10% and a pre-tax return on invested capital of over 50% excluding initial inventory cost (or over 20% including initial inventory cost). Our new stores typically reach a mature sales growth rate within three to four years after opening, with net sales increasing approximately 25% in the aggregate during this time period. For the 57 stores opened since 2010 that have been open for a full twelve months (excluding our 10 acquired stores in 2013), we achieved an average four-wall Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.0% and an average ROIC of 58.3% excluding initial inventory cost (and 22.6% including initial inventory cost) during the first twelve months of operations. In addition, we achieved an average pre-tax payback period of less than one year excluding initial inventory cost and expect to achieve an average pre-tax payback period of approximately 2.5 years including initial inventory cost. &#160; Omni-Channel Strategy &#160; We believe our website is an extension of our brand and our retail stores. Our website, www.sportsmans.com , serves as both a sales channel and a platform for marketing and product education, which allows us to engage more fully with the outdoor community across all of our localities. In 2018, we redeveloped our website to improve functionality and user experience. Our website features a similar merchandise assortment as offered in our stores plus certain products found exclusively online. Regulatory restrictions create certain structural barriers to the online sale of a portion of our revenue, such as firearms, ammunition, certain cutlery, propane and reloading powder. As a result, this portion of our business is currently more protected from online-only retailers, such as Amazon. &#160; We also provide our online customers with convenient omni-channel services. To ensure that our customers have access to our entire assortment of products available on the e-commerce website, our retail stores feature kiosks that allow customers to place orders for items that are available only on our website, out of stock or not regularly stocked. We view our kiosk offering as an important complement to our larger format stores, as well as a key differentiator and extension of our smaller format stores. Our in-store pickup offering allows customers to order products through our e-commerce website and pick up the products in our retail stores without incurring shipping costs. We believe our ship-to-store is a valuable service offering to customers, as well as a means to generate additional foot traffic to our retail stores. Recently, we have introduced the ability for us to ship-from-store to fulfill customer orders. This feature has allowed us to turn a number of our stores into distribution centers, decreasing the time it takes to fulfill orders, and increasing our ability to leverage our inventory across the Company. &#160; In addition, our website features local-area content, including fishing reports and event schedules, as well as online educational resources, including buyer&#8217;s guide, how to&#8217;s, tips, advice and links to video demonstrations on our dedicated YouTube channel. We have also rolled out our social media strategy through our Facebook page and Instagram feed. These platforms allow us to reach our customers more directly with targeted postings of advertisements and in-store events. We believe our online educational resources and community outreach drive traffic to our website and retail stores, while improving user engagement as shoppers move from single-purchase users to loyal customers. We provide online customer service support and fulfill orders through our in-house distribution center and through select partner drop ship integration. In fiscal year 2019, our website received more than 39.6 million visits, which we believe demonstrates our position as a leading resource for outdoor products and product education. &#160; Our Products and Services &#160; Merchandise Strategy &#160; We offer a broad range of products at a variety of price points and carry a deep selection of branded merchandise from well-known manufacturers, such as Browning, Carhartt, Yeti, Coleman, Columbia Sportswear, Federal Premium Ammunition, Honda, Johnson Outdoors, Remington, Shakespeare, Shimano, Smith &#38; Wesson and Under Armour. To reinforce our convenient shopping experience, we offer our products at everyday low prices. We believe our competitive pricing strategy supports our strong value proposition, instills price confidence in both our customers and our sales associates, and is a critical element of our competitive position. &#160; We believe we offer a wider selection of hard goods than many of our key competitors. We employ a good, better, best merchandise strategy, with an emphasis on &#8220;better&#8221; products that meet the needs of customers of all experience levels. We strive to keep our merchandise mix fresh and exciting by continuously searching for new, innovative products and introducing them to our customers. Our hunting and shooting department, which is strategically located at the back of the store, is a key driver of store traffic and one of the reasons for our high frequency of customer visits. We carry a large array of consumable goods, which includes ammunition, bait, cleaning supplies, food, certain lures, propane and reloading supplies. During fiscal year 2019, sales of consumable goods accounted for approximately 37.0% of our unit sales and 19.0% of our dollar sales. We believe the sale of consumables and replenishment items drive repeat traffic, with the majority of our customers visiting our stores multiple times per year (according to our internal surveys). During such visits, our customers frequently browse and purchase other items, including additional gear and accessories. &#160; We also carry a variety of private label and special make-up offerings under the Rustic Ridge TM , Killik TM , Vital Impact TM , Yukon Gold, Lost Creek and Sportsman&#8217;s Warehouse brands as well as special make-up items through vendors such as Tikka, Howa, Camp Chef and various others. These products are designed and priced to complement our branded assortment, by rounding out the offering and ensuring customer choices for good, better and best within key product categories. We believe the clothing, footwear and camping categories present a compelling near-term opportunity to expand our private label offering. In order to address these segments, we previously introduced our proprietary Rustic Ridge TM and Killik TM clothing lines. During fiscal year 2019, private label offerings accounted for approximately 3.4% of our total sales with special make-up offerings accounting for an additional 1.6% of our total sales. This combined total of 5.0% compares to more than 20% for many of our sporting goods retail peers. We believe our private label and special make-up products are an important opportunity to drive sales and increase margins alongside our branded merchandise. &#160; In addition to outfitting our customers with the correct gear, we provide our customers with value-added, technical support services, such as gunsmithing and firearm service plans. Our stores offer full-service archery technician services, fishing-reel line winding, gun bore sighting and scope mounting, and cleaning services. We also help participants enjoy the outdoors responsibly by issuing hunting and fishing licenses. We believe the support services provided by our highly trained staff technicians differentiate us from our competitors, increase customer loyalty and drive repeat traffic to our stores. Products &#160; Our stores are organized into six departments. The table below summarizes the key product lines by department: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Department &#160; Product Offerings Camping &#160; Backpacks, camp essentials, canoes and kayaks, coolers, outdoor cooking equipment, sleeping bags, tents and tools Clothing &#160; Camouflage, jackets, hats, outerwear, sportswear, technical gear and work wear Fishing &#160; Bait, electronics, fishing rods, flotation items, fly fishing, lines, lures, reels, tackle and small boats Footwear &#160; Hiking boots, socks, sport sandals, technical footwear, trail shoes, casual shoes, waders and work boots Hunting and Shooting &#160; Ammunition, archery items, ATV accessories, blinds and tree stands, decoys, firearms, firearms safety and storage, reloading equipment, and shooting gear Optics, Electronics, Accessories, and Other &#160; Gift items, GPS devices, knives, lighting, optics (e.g. binoculars), two-way radios, and other license revenue, net of revenue discounts &#160; Each department has buying and planning teams that are responsible for monitoring product availability from vendors and sales volume within the department and across all stores. We actively monitor the profitability of each product category within each department and adjust our assortment and floor space accordingly. This flexibility enables us to provide customers with more preferred product choices and to enhance the profit potential of each store. &#160; Hunting and shooting have historically been the largest contributor to our sales. Hunting and shooting department products are generally sold at significantly higher price points than other merchandise but often have lower margins. Camping is our second largest department, and family-oriented camping equipment in particular continues to be a high growth product category. Clothing sales have grown as we have introduced new brands and styles, including increasing selections for women and children. We view clothing sales as an important opportunity, given its high gross margins and appeal to a broad, growing demographic. &#160; The following table shows our sales during the past three fiscal years presented by department: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; February 1, &#160; February 2, &#160; February 3, &#160; Department &#160; Product Offerings &#160; &#160; &#160; Camping &#160; Backpacks, camp essentials, canoes and kayaks, coolers, outdoor cooking equipment, sleeping bags, tents and tools 14.4% &#160; 14.2% &#160; 15.1% &#160; Clothing &#160; Camouflage, jackets, hats, outerwear, sportswear, technical gear and work wear 9.3% &#160; 8.9% &#160; 9.3% &#160; Fishing &#160; Bait, electronics, fishing rods, flotation items, fly fishing, lines, lures, reels, tackle and small boats 11.1% &#160; 10.6% &#160; 10.7% &#160; Footwear &#160; Hiking boots, socks, sport sandals, technical footwear, trail shoes, casual shoes, waders and work boots 7.5% &#160; 7.3% &#160; 7.4% &#160; Hunting and Shooting &#160; Ammunition, archery items, ATV accessories, blinds and tree stands, decoys, firearms, reloading equipment and shooting gear 49.1% &#160; 48.3% &#160; 48.7% &#160; Optics, Electronics, Accessories, and Other &#160; Gift items, GPS devices, knives, lighting, optics (e.g. binoculars), two-way radios, and other license revenue, net of revenue discounts 8.6% &#160; 10.7% &#160; 8.8% &#160; Total &#160; &#160; 100.0% &#160; 100.0% &#160; 100.0% &#160; &#160; &#160; Camping .

We primarily offer well-known brands in our clothing department, such as Carhartt, Columbia, Sitka, and Under Armour. We also intend to grow our private label clothing lines, including Rustic Ridge TM and Killik TM . Our clothing selection offers technical performance capabilities for a variety of hunting activities, including upland game, waterfowl, archery, big game hunting, turkey hunting and shooting sports. Performance attributes include waterproofing, temperature control, scent control features and visual capabilities, such as blaze orange and camouflage in a wide range of patterns. Outerwear, particularly performance rainwear, is an important product category for customers who are fishing, hiking, hunting or marine enthusiasts. We further complement our technical clothing with an assortment of casual clothing that fits our customers&#8217; lifestyles, including a variety of branded graphic t-shirts, and private label motto t-shirts. &#160; Fishing . Fishing represented approximately 11.1% of our net sales during fiscal year 2019 and includes products for fresh-water fishing, salt-water fishing, fly-fishing, ice-fishing and boating. Our broad assortment appeals to the beginning and weekend angler, as well as avid and tournament anglers. In addition to lures, rods and reels, our fishing assortment features a wide selection of products in tackle management and organization, electronics, fly-fishing, ice-fishing and marine accessories sub-categories. We also provide fishing-reel line winding services in all of our stores and live bait in most of our stores. We offer products for boat care and maintenance, as well as safety equipment and aquatic products such as float tubes and pontoons. All of our stores also sell fishing licenses. Our fishing department includes brands such as Johnson Outdoors, Normark, Plano, Pure Fishing, Rivers Wild Flies, and Shimano. &#160; Footwear .

Products such as ammunition, firearms cleaning supplies, firearms, firearms safety and storage and reloading products are typically key drivers of traffic in our stores. Our hunting and shooting merchandise assortment provides equipment, accessories and consumable supplies for virtually every type of hunting and shooting sport.

Our other department includes miscellaneous products and services. &#160; Loyalty Programs &#160; We have a loyalty program through which our customers are able to earn &#8220;points&#8221; towards Sportsman&#8217;s Warehouse gift cards on most of their purchases. The program is free to join and accepted both online and in-stores for purchases and the use of redemption cards. As of February 1, 2020, we had approximately 2.2 million participants in our loyalty program and approximately 50% of our revenue is generated from our loyalty customers. &#160; Customers may obtain a loyalty program card when making a purchase in-store or online. After obtaining a card, the customer must register on our website in order to redeem loyalty rewards. Customers earn one point for each dollar spent, with the exception of certain items, such as gift cards and fish and game licenses. For every 100 points accumulated, the customer is entitled to a $1.00 credit in loyalty rewards, which may be redeemed by logging into our website to request a redemption card for any whole dollar amount (subject to the customer&#8217;s available point balance). The redemption card is then mailed to the customer and operates as a gift card to be used for in-store and\/or online purchasing. The rewards points expire after 12 months of dormancy. &#160; In addition, we offer our customers the multi-use Explorewards VISA Credit Card and the Explorewards Credit Card issued by Comenity Bank. Comenity Bank extends credit directly to cardholders and provides all servicing for the credit card accounts, funds the rewards and bears all credit and fraud losses. The Explorewards Visa Card allows customers to earn points whenever and wherever they use their card while the Explorewards Credit Card can be used only in Sportsman&#8217;s Warehouse stores and at Sportsman.com. Customers may redeem earned points for products and services just as they would redeem loyalty card points. &#160; Sourcing and Distribution &#160; Sourcing &#160; We maintain central purchasing, replenishment and distribution functions to manage inventory planning, allocate merchandise to stores and oversee the replenishment of basic merchandise to the distribution center. We have no long-term purchase commitments. During fiscal year 2019, we purchased merchandise from approximately 1,500 vendors with no vendor accounting for more than approximately 5% of total merchandise purchased. We have established long-standing, continuous relationships with our largest vendors. &#160; Our sourcing organization is currently managed by our merchant team in our corporate headquarters. We also have field merchants that coordinate certain merchandising functions at the store level to provide a more localized merchandising model. To ensure that our product offerings are tailored to local market conditions and demand, our merchant teams regularly meet one-on-one with our vendors, and attend trade shows, review trade periodicals and evaluate merchandise offered by other retail and online merchants. We also frequently gather feedback and new product reviews from our store management and employees, as well as from reviews submitted by our customers. We believe this feedback is valuable to our vendor-partners and improves our access to new models and technologies. &#160; &#160; Distribution and Fulfillment &#160; We currently distribute all of our merchandise from our 507,000 square foot distribution center in Salt Lake City, Utah. The distribution center supports replenishment for all stores and manages the fulfillment of direct-to-consumer e-commerce orders. We use preferred carriers for replenishment to our retail stores. We ship merchandise to our e-commerce customers via courier service. An experienced distribution management team leads a staff of approximately 400 employees at peak inventory levels heading into the fourth quarter. &#160; The distribution center has dynamic systems and processes that we believe can accommodate continued new store growth. We use the HighJump Warehouse Management System (&#8220;WMS&#8221;) to manage all activities. The system is highly adaptable and can be easily changed to accommodate new business requirements. For example, our WMS enabled us to support full omni-channel distribution under one roof by allowing us to comingle inventory to optimize space requirements and labor. Additionally, we have developed customized radio frequency and voice-directed processes to handle the specific requirements of our operations. We have the capability to both case pick and item pick, which is designed to ensure that our stores have sufficient quantities of product while also allowing us to maintain appropriate in-stock levels. This balance allows us to effectively manage inventory and maximize sales in stores. Marketing and Advertising &#160; We believe, based on internal surveys, that the majority of our customers are male, between the ages of 35 and 65, and have an annual household income between $40,000 and $100,000. We also actively market to women and have expanded our product offerings of women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s outerwear, clothing and footwear to address rising participation rates in hunting and shooting sports, as well as overall outdoor activity. &#160; Our primary marketing efforts are focused on driving additional consumers to the stores and increasing the frequency and profitability of visits by customers of all types. We employ a two-pronged marketing approach: &#160; &#183; regional advertising programs; and &#160; &#183; local grassroots efforts to build brand awareness and customer loyalty. &#160; Our regional advertising programs emphasize seasonal requirements for hunting, fishing and camping in our various store geographies. Our advertising medium is typically newspaper inserts (primarily multi-page color inserts during key shopping periods such as the Christmas season and Father&#8217;s Day), supplemented with modest amounts of direct mail, local and national television ads and out-of-home media buys. We proactively modify the timing and content of our message to match local and regional preferences, changing seasons, weather patterns and topography of a given region. In addition, the use of co-op funding with select vendors to supplement our out-of-pocket media expenses allows us to improve brand exposure through various advertising vehicles, while partnering with national brands in relevant media channels. This program also reinforces the general consumer&#8217;s impression of Sportsman&#8217;s Warehouse as a preferred retailer for those brands. Finally, we sponsor regional and national television programming, including the Angler&#8217;s Channel, Fishful Thinking, Hooked on Utah and Eastman&#8217;s Hunting TV. Our total marketing expense for fiscal year 2019 was approximately $14.4 million, excluding co-op reimbursement of $2.9 million. &#160; The second prong of our marketing effort involves fostering grassroots relationships in the local community. Each Sportsman&#8217;s Warehouse store employs a variety of outreach tools to build local awareness. One key component to our local marketing strategy is hosting events throughout the year, targeting a variety of end-user customer profiles (such as hunters, campers, anglers and women). In total, our store base hosts or facilitates approximately 3,000 in-store and offsite seminars and events per year, such as ladies&#8217; night, Eastman&#8217;s Deer Tour, Waterfowl Weekend, Conservation Days contest and Bucks &#38; Bulls. We are also active in supporting a variety of conservation groups, such as Ducks Unlimited, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, Mule Deer Foundation and the National Wild Turkey Federation, both at the corporate level and through store employee local memberships and participation. Company representatives attend more than 600 events annually to provide support for these organizations and to solidify ties between their members and the Sportsman&#8217;s brand. Furthermore, we believe that the Sportsman&#8217;s News newspaper, offered in-store, provides a unique point of contact with our customers by offering outdoor stories, product reviews, how-to articles and new product introductions. Such grass roots marketing campaigns and local outreach enable us to reduce our initial marketing spend in connection with new store openings. We believe that these initiatives are highly cost-effective tools to create brand awareness and engender a loyal community of local customers, as well as differentiate Sportsman&#8217;s from its national competitors. &#160; Hiring, Training and Motivating our Employees &#160; We believe that the recruitment, training and knowledge of our employees and the consistency and quality of the service they deliver are central to our success. We emphasize deep product knowledge for store managers and sales associates during both the hiring and training stages. We hire most of our sales associates for a specific department or product category. All of our managers and sales associates undergo focused sales training, consisting of both sales techniques and specialized product instruction, both immediately upon hiring (approximately 20 hours) and continuing throughout their career (approximately 16 hours annually). In addition, our sales associates receive loss prevention instruction and departmental training upon hiring. For example, in our hunting department, all employees receive an additional nine hours of training on ATF and company policies initially upon hire, with continuing education throughout the year. Our store managers complete two to six months of on-the-job training at another store with a Sportsman&#8217;s district manager, as part of which they receive approximately 80 hours of dedicated managerial training and instruction. Our department heads receive extensive online training as well as on-site instruction, totaling approximately 40 hours. As a result of these programs, our employees are highly trained to provide friendly and non-intimidating education, guidance and support to address our customers&#8217; needs. Our employees are often outdoor enthusiasts, participating in outdoor activities alongside our customers in the local community. Our employees spend a portion of their gross wages in-store, underscoring their passion for both our company and the outdoor lifestyle. We believe our level of employee store patronage and employee expertise are unique among our competitors in this industry and enhances our differentiated shopping experience. &#160; One of our unique assets is a designated training room located at our headquarters. Our training room is used frequently for firm-wide training programs and by vendors to stage training demonstrations for new products. Training room sessions are broadcast real-time in high definition to each store location and are recorded for future viewing. Vendor training is particularly interactive, permitting vendor representatives to present a uniform message simultaneously to all employees, while allowing managers and sales staff in individual stores to ask questions and provide real-time feedback on products. This system increases vendors&#8217; product knowledge reach and provides more effective training to our employees. Training room sessions are especially important for technical products, with numerous design features and a high unit price, because they enable our sales associates to better educate customers and provide additional assurance that a given product fits the customer&#8217;s needs. Given its utility as a cost-effective sales tool, our training room is reserved well in advance by vendors. We believe our training program has been a critical factor in increasing conversion and average ticket growth. &#160; Information Technology &#160; Business-critical information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) systems include the following: supply chain, merchandise, point-of-sale (&#8220;POS&#8221;), WMS, e-commerce, loss prevention and financial and payroll. Our IT infrastructure is robustly designed to be able to access real-time data from any store or channel. The network infrastructure allows us to quickly and cost effectively add new stores to the wide area network (&#8220;WAN&#8221;). The private WAN is built on a CenturyLink backbone with all of its resources and support. Additionally, we have implemented a redundant wireless WAN on Verizon&#8217;s infrastructure. All key systems will continue to run in the event of a power or network outage. All data is backed up daily from one storage array to another storage array. &#160; We have implemented what we believe to be best-in-class software for all of our major business-critical systems. Key operating systems include Oracle Applications for ERP, SAP Commerce for our e-commerce channel, Salesforce&#8217;s (formally Tomax&#8217;s) Retail.net and JPOS for in-store functionality, and HighJump for WMS. Our physical infrastructure is also built on products from premier vendors Cisco, Dell, Oracle Sun and VMWare. Originally designed with the goal of being able to run a significantly larger retail business, our IT systems are scalable to support our growth. &#160; Furthermore, we have incorporated enhanced reporting tools that allow for more comprehensive and granular monitoring of business performance, which has been critical to management&#8217;s ability to drive financial results. Management has access to a reporting dashboard that shows key performance indicators (&#8220;KPIs&#8221;) on a company, store, department and category level. KPIs include multiple variables and are all available on a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis. All KPIs are compared to comparable prior year periods. District, store and department managers have access to the data relevant to their area of responsibility. Real-time, up to the second, sales data is available on demand. The system allows for custom-created reports as required. &#160; Intellectual Property &#160; Sportsman&#8217;s Warehouse &#174; , Sportsman&#8217;s Warehouse America&#8217;s Premier Outfitter &#174; , Lost Creek &#174; , LC Lost Creek Fishing Gear and Accessories &#174; , Rustic Ridge TM , Killik TM , K Killik &#38; Design TM , LC &#38; Design TM , and Vital Impact TM are among our service marks or trademarks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, we own several other registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks involving advertising slogans and other names and phrases used in our business. We also own numerous domain names, including www.sportsmans.com , among others. The information on, or that can be accessed through, our websites is not a part of this filing. &#160; We believe that our trademarks are valid and valuable and intend to maintain our trademarks and any related registrations. We do not know of any material pending claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use our marks in the United States or elsewhere. We have no franchises or other concessions that are material to our operations. &#160; Our Market and Competition &#160; Our Market &#160; We compete in the large, growing and fragmented outdoor activities and sporting goods market, which we believe is currently underserved by full-line multi-activity retailers. We believe, based on 2018 reports by the Bureau of Economic analysis, that U.S. outdoor activities and sporting goods retail sales in our related product categories total over $90 billion. The U.S. outdoor activities and sporting goods sector is comprised of three primary categories&#8212;equipment, clothing and footwear&#8212;with each category containing distinct product sets to support a variety of activities, including hunting, fishing, camping and shooting, as well as other sporting goods activities. &#160; We believe growth in the U.S. outdoor activities and sporting goods market is driven by several key trends, centered around enhancing performance and enjoyment while participating in sporting and outdoor activities, including new product introductions, and the resilience of consumer demand for purchases in these categories versus other discretionary categories. We believe these factors will continue to foster growth in the outdoor activities and sporting goods market in the future. &#160; Within the retail sporting goods sector, we operate primarily in the outdoor equipment, clothing and footwear segment, which includes hunting and shooting, fishing, camping and boating. This segment is growing at a faster rate than the sporting goods industry at large. The 2016 U.S. Fish and Wildlife national survey, published once every five years, found that fishing participation increased 9% and participation in wildlife relation recreation increased 6%, for Americans aged 16 and older from 2011 to 2016. &#160; Furthermore, we believe that specialty retailers have generated incremental sales volume by expanding their presence, especially in smaller communities, which has increased customers&#8217; access to products that formerly were less available. The nature of the outdoor activities to which we cater requires recurring purchases throughout the year, resulting in high rates of conversion among customers. For example, active anglers typically purchase various fishing tackle throughout the year based on seasons and changing conditions. Hunting with firearms typically is accompanied by recurring purchases of ammunition and cleaning supplies throughout the year and multiple firearm styles for different hunted game. &#160; Competition &#160; We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry are breadth and depth of product selection, including locally relevant offerings, value pricing, convenient locations, technical services and customer service. A few of our competitors have a larger number of stores, and some of them have a greater market presence, name recognition and financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we have. We believe that we compete effectively with our competitors with our distinctive branded selection and superior customer service, as well as our commitment to understanding and providing merchandise that is relevant to our targeted customer base. We cater to the outdoor enthusiast and believe that we have both an in-depth knowledge of the technical outdoor customer and a &#8220;grab and go&#8221; store environment that is uniquely conducive to their need for value and convenience. We believe that our flexible box size, combined with our low-cost, high-service model, also allows us to enter into and serve smaller markets that our larger competitors cannot penetrate as effectively. Finally, certain barriers, including legal restrictions, exist on the sale of our product offerings that comprise a portion of our revenue, such as firearms, ammunition, certain cutlery, propane and reloading powder, create a structural barrier to competition from many online retailers, such as Amazon. &#160; Our principal competitors include the following: &#160; &#183; independent, local specialty stores, often referred to as &#8220;mom &#38; pops&#8221;; &#160; &#183; other specialty retailers that compete with us across a significant portion of our merchandising categories through retail store, catalog or e-commerce businesses, such as Bass Pro Shops and Cabela&#8217;s; &#160; &#183; large-format sporting goods stores and chains, such as Academy Sports + Outdoors; and &#160; &#183; mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, discount stores, department stores and online retailers, such as Amazon, Target and Wal-Mart. Independent, Local Specialty Stores . These stores generally range in size from approximately 2,000 to 10,000 square feet, and typically focus on one or two specific product categories, such as hunting, fishing or camping, and usually lack a broad selection of product. &#160; Other Specialty Retailers. Some of the other specialty retailers that compete with us across a significant portion of our merchandising categories are large-format retailers that generally range in size from 40,000 to 250,000 square feet. These retailers seek to offer a broad selection of merchandise focused on hunting, fishing, camping and other outdoor product categories. Some of these stores combine the characteristics of an outdoor retailer with outdoor entertainment and theme attractions. We believe that the number of these stores that can be supported in any single market area is limited because of their large size and significant per-store buildout cost. &#160; Other specialty retailers are smaller chains that typically focus on offering a broad selection of merchandise in one or more of the following product categories&#8212;hunting, fishing, camping or other outdoor product categories. We believe that these other outdoor-focused chains generally do not offer a similar depth and breadth of merchandise or specialized services in all of our product categories. &#160; Large-Format Sporting Goods Stores and Chains . These stores generally range from 20,000 to 80,000 square feet and offer a broad selection of sporting goods merchandise covering a variety of sporting goods categories, including baseball, basketball, football and home gyms, as well as hunting, fishing and camping. However, we believe that the amount of space at these stores devoted to our outdoor product categories limits the extent of their offerings in these areas. &#160; Mass Merchandisers, Warehouse Clubs, Discount Stores, Department Stores and Online Retailers . With respect to retailers in this category with physical locations, these stores generally range in size from approximately 50,000 to over 200,000 square feet and are primarily located in shopping centers, free-standing sites or regional malls. Hunting, fishing and camping merchandise and clothing represent a small portion of the stores&#8217; assortment and their total sales. We believe that less than 10% of our product offering and less than five percent of our hunting and shooting product offering overlap with these stores. &#160; Over the past decade, specialty retailers, like Sportsman&#8217;s, have gained market share of equipment sales at the expense of mass merchants, discount stores and small independent retailers. We believe the small independent retailers (or &#8220;mom &#38; pop&#8221; shops) comprise approximately 65% of the market for outdoor specialty retail products. In addition, while there are over 60,000 Type 01 Federal Firearms Licenses, or FFLs, in the United States today, only 4,000 are currently held by national or regional specialty stores. Since FFLs are issued at the store level, these statistics imply that the remaining 95% of the market is fragmented among mom &#38; pop shops. We believe this fragmentation within the total addressable market presents an attractive opportunity for us to continue to expand our market share, as customers increasingly prefer a broad and appealing selection of merchandise, competitive prices, high levels of service and one-stop shopping convenience. &#160; Seasonality &#160; We experience moderate seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating results as a result of holiday spending and the opening of hunting seasons. While our sales are more balanced throughout the year than many retailers, historically, our sales are moderately higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters than in the other quarterly periods. On average, over the last three fiscal years, we have generated approximately 27.0% and 29.0% of our net sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters, respectively, which includes the holiday selling season as well as the opening of the Fall hunting season. However, Spring hunting, Father&#8217;s Day and the availability of hunting and fishing throughout the year in many of our markets counterbalance this seasonality to a certain degree. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\" &#160; Regulation and Compliance &#160; Regulation and Legislation &#160; We operate in a highly regulated industry. There are a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect our business. In every state in which we operate, we must obtain various licenses and\/or permits in order to operate our business. &#160; Because we sell firearms at all of our retail stores, we are subject to regulation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (the &#8220;ATF&#8221;). Each store has an FFL permitting the sale of firearms, and our distribution center has obtained an FFL to store and distribute firearms. Certain states require a state license to sell firearms and we have obtained these licenses for the states in which we operate that have such a requirement. &#160; We must comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, including the National Firearms Act of 1934 (the &#8220;NFA&#8221;), the Gun Control Act of 1968 (the &#8220;GCA&#8221;), the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 and Internal Revenue Code provisions applicable to the Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax, all of which have been amended from time to time. The NFA and GCA require our business to, among other things, maintain Federal Firearms Licenses for our locations and perform a pre-transfer background check in connection with all firearms purchases. We perform this background check using either the FBI-managed National Instant Criminal Background Check System(&#8220;NICS&#8221;), or a comparable state government-managed system that relies on NICS and any additional information collected by the state. These background check systems either confirm that a transfer can be made, deny the transfer or require that the transfer be delayed for further review, and provide us with a transaction number for the proposed transfer. We are required to record the transaction number on an ATF Form 4473 and retain this form in our records for auditing purposes for 20 years for each approved transfer and five years for each denied or delayed transaction. &#160; The federal categories of prohibited purchasers are the prevailing minimum for all states. States (and, in some cases, local governments) on occasion enact laws that further restrict permissible purchases of firearms. We are also subject to numerous other federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding firearm sale procedures, record keeping, inspection and reporting, including adhering to minimum age restrictions regarding the purchase or possession of firearms or ammunition, residency requirements, applicable waiting periods, importation regulations and regulations pertaining to the shipment and transportation of firearms. &#160; In September 2004, Congress declined to renew the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 (the &#8220;AWB&#8221;), which prohibited the manufacture of certain firearms defined as &#8220;assault weapons,&#8221; restricted the sale or possession of &#8220;assault weapons,&#8221; except those that were manufactured prior to the law&#8217;s enactment, and placed restrictions on the sale of new high-capacity ammunition feeding devices. Various states and local jurisdictions, including California, Colorado, New York and Washington (states in which we operate), have adopted their own versions of the AWB or high capacity ammunition feeding device restrictions, some of which restrictions apply to the products we sell in other states. If a statute similar to the AWB were to be enacted or re-enacted at the federal level, it would impact our ability to sell certain products. Additionally, state and local governments have proposed laws and regulations that, if enacted, would place additional restrictions on the manufacture, transfer, sale, purchase, possession and use of firearms, ammunition and shooting-related products. For example, several states, such as California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Washington have enacted laws and regulations that are more restrictive than federal laws and regulations that limit access to and sale of certain firearms and ammunition. California, Connecticut and New York impose mandatory screening of ammunition purchases; California and the District of Columbia have requirements for microstamping (that is, engraving the handgun&#8217;s serial number on each cartridge) of new handguns; Washington recently passed legislation that, among other things, raises the minimum age to purchase certain firearms to 21 from 18 and imposes a multi-day waiting period on gun purchases. California also raised the minimum age to purchase certain firearms to 21 and enacted several restrictions, including background checks on ammunition sales. Some states prohibit the sale of guns without internal or external locking mechanisms. Other state or local governmental entities may also explore similar legislative or regulatory initiatives that may further restrict the manufacture, sale, purchase, possession or use of firearms, ammunition and shooting-related products. &#160; The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (&#8220;PLCAA&#8221;), which became effective in October 2005, prohibits civil liability actions from being brought or continued in any federal or state court against federally licensed manufacturers, distributors, dealers or importers of firearms or ammunition for damages, punitive damages, injunctive or declaratory relief, abatement, restitution, fines, penalties or other relief resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product by third parties. The legislation does not preclude traditional product liability actions. &#160; We are also subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, protection of the environment, human health and safety, advertising, pricing, weights and measures, product safety and other matters. Some of these laws affect or restrict the manner in which we can sell certain items, such as handguns, smokeless powder, black powder substitutes, ammunition, pepper spray, bows, knives and other products. State and local laws and regulations governing hunting, fishing, boating, all-terrain vehicles and other outdoor activities and equipment can also affect our business. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the terms of such laws and that we have no liabilities under such laws that we expect could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. &#160; In addition, many of our imported products are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the United States and other countries or impact the cost of such products. To date, quotas in the operation of our business have not restricted us, and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of our products. &#160; Our e-commerce business is subject to the Mail or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule and related regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (the &#8220;FTC&#8221;), which affect our catalog mail order operations. FTC regulations, in general, govern the solicitation of orders, the information provided to prospective customers and the timeliness of shipments and refunds. In addition, the FTC has established guidelines for advertising and labeling many of the products we sell. &#160; Compliance &#160; We are routinely inspected by the ATF and various state agencies to ensure compliance with federal and local regulations. While we view such inspections as a starting point, we employ more thorough internal compliance inspections to help ensure we are in compliance with all applicable laws. With the IT infrastructure systems we have in place, certain components of inspections can be done remotely. &#160; We dedicate significant resources to ensure compliance with applicable federal, state and local regulations. Since we began operations in 1986, we have never had a license revoked. &#160; We are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations relating to, among other things, advertising and product restrictions. Some of these laws prohibit or limit the sale, in certain states and locations, of certain items, such as black powder firearms, ammunition, bows, knives and similar products. Our compliance department administers various restriction codes and other software tools to prevent the sale of such jurisdictionally-restricted items. &#160; We have particular expertise in the California market and have passed several California Department of Justice (&#8220;CA DOJ&#8221;) firearm audits with zero or only minor violations. The CA DOJ communicates with us for policy discussion, recognizing the strength of our compliance infrastructure. . &#160; Employees &#160; As of February 1, 2020, we had approximately 5,400 total employees. Of our total employees, approximately 240 were based at our corporate headquarters in West Jordan, Utah, approximately 340 employees were located at our distribution center and approximately 4,820 were store employees. We had approximately 2,350 full-time employees and approximately 3,050 part-time employees, who are primarily store employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe our positive relationship with our employees is one of the keys to success. &#160; Available Information &#160; Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, are available on our web site at www.sportsmans.com , free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after the electronic filing of these reports with, or furnishing of these reports to, the SEC.

BusinessOur CompanyWe are a development-stage biotechnology company focused on advancing novel antiviral therapies to treat diseases associated with a viral triggered abnormal immune response such as fibromyalgia (&#8220;FM&#8221;). Overactive immune response related to activation of tissue resident Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (&#8220;HSV-1&#8221;) has been postulated to be a potential root cause of chronic illnesses such as FM, irritable bowel disease (&#8220;IBS&#8221;), chronic fatigue syndrome and other functional somatic syndromes, all of which are characterized by a waxing and waning manifestation of disease. While not completely understood, there is general agreement in the medical community that activation of HSV-1 is triggered by some form of environmental and\/or health stressor. Our lead candidate, IMC-1, is a novel, proprietary, fixed dose combination of famciclovir and celecoxib. IMC-1 represents a novel combination, dual mechanism antiviral therapy designed to synergistically suppress HSV-1 activation and replication, with the end goal of reducing viral mediated disease burden.IMC-1 combines two specific mechanisms of action purposely designed to inhibit HSV-1 activation and replication, thereby keeping HSV-1 in a latent (dormant) state or &#8220;down-regulating&#8221; HSV-1 from a lytic (active) state back to latency. The famciclovir component of IMC-1 inhibits viral DNA replication. The celecoxib component of IMC-1 inhibits cyclooxegenase-2 (&#8220;COX-2&#8221;) and to a lesser degree COX-1 enzymes, used by HSV-1 to amplify or accelerate its own replication. We are unaware of any other antivirals in development for the treatment of FM. This novel approach was a germane consideration in FDA designating IMC-1 for fast-track review status for the treatment of FM. IMC-1 has also been granted a synergy patent based on the fact that neither of the individual components has proven effective in the management of fibromyalgia, yet the dual mechanism combination therapy generated a result in preliminary studies that appears to be greater than the sum of its parts.Dormant HSV-1 is Reactivated by External Triggers and AmplifiesIts Own Replication via Cyclooxygenase (COX 1 and COX 2) Enzymes&#8203; IMC-1&#8217;s Novel, Synergistic Antiviral Mechanism Suppresses Viral Replication,Demonstrates FM Treatment Effect&#8203; The potential of IMC-1 in FM is underpinned by statistically significant improvement versus placebo in the primary endpoint of pain reduction as demonstrated in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2a proof-of-concept study in FM patients. This proof of concept study generated statistically significant clinical data on the effects of IMC-1 on both primary pain assessment and secondary measures of pain reduction, reduction in fatigue and improvement in the global health status in patients diagnosed with FM. A result is considered to be statistically significant when the probability of the result occurring by random chance, rather than from the efficacy of the treatment, is sufficiently low. The conventional method for measuring the statistical significance of a result is known as the &#8220;p-value,&#8221; which represents the probability that random chance caused the result (e.g., a p-value = 0.001 means that there is a 0.1% or less probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance. Generally, a p-value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant, and may be supportive of a finding of efficacy by regulatory authorities. However, regulatory authorities, including the FDA and EMA, do not rely on strict statistical significance thresholds as criteria for marketing approval and maintain the flexibility to evaluate the overall risks and benefits of a treatment.The table below demonstrates the significant differences observed in the proof of concept study between IMC-1 and placebo in change from baseline using both the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 24 hour recall pain data and the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-R) with LOCF\/BOCF imputation.&#8203; IMC-1 also exhibited consistent improvement across several secondary FM treatment outcomes, including 50% responder analysis, functional assessments, lower chronic fatigue, increased time to rescue medication and improvements in FM patient&#8217;s overall global health status. One key secondary measure assessing a 30% pain reduction analysis did not meet statistical significance. In the Phase 2a study, IMC-1 demonstrated a lower discontinuation rate due to adverse events as compared with placebo.There were no deaths during the study and only three serious adverse events (&#8220;SAEs&#8221;) were reported. The two in the IMC-1 group were a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and a facial cellulitis and one in the placebo group was a right breast micro-metastatic ductal carcinoma. One of the 3 SAEs was considered possibly related to study treatment &#8212; the non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction that occurred early in the study in a 47-year- old patient treated with IMC-1. The causal relationship of this SAE to treatment with IMC-1 cannot be ruled out and as such was determined to be &#8220;possibly related&#8221; to IMC-1; however, the patient&#8217;s underlying coronary artery disease and strong family history of premature cardiac disease suggest that other causal factors might also have been involved.Based on the significant unmet need in treating FM and the aforementioned Phase 2a FM data, IMC-1 has been granted FDA designation for fast-track review status. In addition, the novel mechanism of IMC-1 has enabled us to secure composition of matter intellectual property (patent) protection to 2033.Following on from our successful Phase 2a trial, we held an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. and agreed to initiate either a Phase 2b study or a Phase 3 program after we provide animal toxicology study data, to conduct a human PK study and a clinical trial protocol that includes monitoring renal function through standard safety labs to the FDA. A human PK study with the combined tablet of IMC-1 was completed and performed as expected, with no drug-drug interactions and no adverse events. Multiple dose PK of IMC-1 was well characterized and provides additional data to better understand the PK profile of IMC-1. As a result, we are now seeking to take IMC-1 from Phase 2a proof-of-concept to a larger scale Phase 2b clinical trial of IMC-1 for the treatment of FM. The Phase 2b and chronic toxicology studies are planned components of the registration package supporting Phase 3 requirements.For the Phase 3 program, we intend to run either one or two qualifying pivotal trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of IMC-1 treating patients with fibromyalgia. The first Phase 3 study is planned to be a four-arm multifactorial design to demonstrate the relative safety and efficacy of IMC-1 as compared to celecoxib alone, famciclovir alone and placebo. All patients from the first Phase 3 study will be offered the opportunity to enroll into an open label safety follow-on extension study with all on IMC-1. If this study meets its primary efficacy endpoint, we plan to negotiate with FDA to either accept the large Phase 2b to qualify as an adequate and well-controlled trial as part of the Phase 3 program or conduct a second pivotal study.Background of Fibromyalgia (FM)FM is a widespread chronic pain disorder including severe symptoms of fatigue lasting 3 months or longer in duration. FM is also characterized by generalized aching, muscle stiffness, non-restorative sleep, chronic fatigue, depression, cognitive impairment and disturbances in bowel function. Researchers estimate that FM affects 2% to 8% of the US population and is the second most common &#8220;rheumatic disorder,&#8221; second to osteoarthritis. The National Fibromyalgia &#38; Chronic Pain Association estimates that 10 million Americans have FM.There are approximately 3.6 million patients in the U.S. that have been diagnosed with FM, with approximately 2 million being treated. Because there are no specific clinical or laboratory tests available to diagnose FM, diagnosis is established by demonstrating that a patient has widespread chronic pain in 7 or more of the 19 bodily locations for at least 3 months in duration. Additionally, these patients may also have non-restorative sleep, life altering fatigue, and cognitive impairment. The underlying cause of FM has remained elusive and frustrated treating physicians and the scientific community alike. To date, the products approved for the treatment of FM have the potential to cause troublesome side effects and\/or deliver limited efficacy.The American College of Rheumatology (&#8220;ACR&#8221;) has provided working definitions for the diagnosis of FM. ACR published its 1990 criteria and 2010 criteria to assist physicians in making this diagnosis. The 1990 criteria require that patients have widespread chronic pain in all four quadrants of the body for at least 3 months duration and at least 11 out of 18 predefined tender point sites are painful. The 2010 criteria revision introduced the concepts of a widespread pain index (&#8220;WPI&#8221;) and symptom severity scale score (&#8220;SSS&#8221;) for at least 3 months and no other explanation for the chronic symptoms. In 2016, the ACR developed a revision of the 2010\/2011 FM criteria. FM may now be diagnosed in adults when all of the following criteria are met:&#9679; WPI &#8805; 7 and SSS score &#8805; 5 OR WPI = 4-6 and SSS score &#8805; 9; &#9679; Generalized pain, defined as pain in at least 4 of 5 regions, is present; and &#9679; Symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least 3 months. A diagnosis of fibromyalgia is valid irrespective of other diagnoses and does not exclude the presence of other clinically important illnesses.Fibromyalgia: A Serious Condition with Unmet Medical NeedFM is associated with increased mortality due to suicide or accident. Researchers evaluating over 8,186 patients with FM across three different sites in the US between 1974 and 2009 found that individuals with FM were more than three times as likely (odds ratio (&#8220;OR&#8221;) = 3.31) to die from suicide compared to the general population and were at increased risk of death due to accidents (OR = 1.45, 95% confidence interval (&#8220;CI&#8221;); 1.02-2.06). This led the authors to speculate that some of the deaths that were classified as accidents may actually have been suicides, suggesting an even higher rate of suicide among these patients. This increased risk of mortality associated with the diagnosis of FM suggests that FM is a serious disease and a significant unmet medical need.In 2018, the FDA conducted a Patient-Focused Drug Development (PFDD) meeting with over 400 individuals or caregivers of individuals who experience chronic pain. Based on input from that meeting, the FDA reported that despite patient use of FDA approved and off-label therapies, the majority of FM patients continue to experience worsening pain, fatigue, cognitive impairment and other symptoms over time that requires increasing utilization of significant healthcare resources. In a 2001 study of 100 cases of FM in Ontario, Canada, patients reported spending most of at least one day in bed over the previous two weeks because of their health, and they spent more total days in bed compared to pain control and general control groups. Such unresolved morbidity significantly impacts the day-to-day functioning of patients suffering from FM.Under the fifth authorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA V), from 2013-2018, the FDA conducted 24 disease-specific PFDD meetings to better understand patients&#8217; perspectives on their condition and the available therapies to treat their conditions. March 26, 2014 the FDA held a public meeting with patients suffering from FM. The meeting was chaired by 5 panelists from FDA who interviewed 10 patients with FM who expressed FM to be a condition with an unmet medical need. Patients described the impact of FM on their daily lives, and their experiences with currently available therapies. During FDA&#8217;s meeting on the diagnosis, symptoms and treatment options for FM, the FDA acknowledged that: &#8220;There is a continuing need for treatments to better manage symptoms and treat the underlying condition.&#8221; Patients described prescription drugs as having widely varying degrees of effectiveness, with many participants noting limited benefits or decreased benefit over time. Additionally, even when effective, many FM patients described that they could not adhere to treatment regimens because they were unable to tolerate treatment side effects. The following complaints, summarized from patient comments from the PFDD meeting and public comments submitted to the meeting docket, demonstrate the significant limitations of the three drugs approved by FDA for the management of FM.Lyrica (pregabalin) &#8212; FDA Approved June 2007a. Discontinuation of Lyrica after a few weeks due to negative side effects, most notably drowsiness, cognitive issues, dizziness, effects on mood, and weight gain. Other side effects noted included depression and swelling of the mouth and tongue. b. Loss of effectiveness over time. c. Withdrawal symptoms after discontinuing Lyrica. Cymbalta (duloxetine) &#8212; FDA Approved June 2008(1) Negative side effects such as headache, vertigo, sleep issues, fatigue, mood disruptions, loss of libido, nausea, cognitive issues, weight gain, swelling of the mouth and tongue, vision problems and suicidal thoughts. (2) Severe withdrawal symptoms after discontinuing Cymbalta. Savella (milnacipran) &#8212; FDA Approved January 2009a. Discontinuation of Savella due to side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure, excessive sweating, and mood disruptions. b. Ineffective or intolerable side effects. Lyrica, Cymbalta and Savella modify central pain processing; pregabalin via modulation of voltage-gated calcium channels, and duloxetine and milnacipran via serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition (&#8220;SNRI&#8221;). Current treatments, including FDA approved therapies, prescription drugs used off-label and other non-prescription treatments are generally ineffective in managing FM for most patients. In a survey developed by the National Fibromyalgia Association (&#8220;NFA&#8221;) that was completed by 2,596 FM patients via the Internet in 2007, respondents reported using over twenty different medications (polypharmacy), including the use of opioids, to manage their FM. The survey questionnaire was developed by the NFA and the questionnaire underwent several rounds of testing to improve its face validity, content validity, clarity and readability before it was posted on the Internet. The questionnaire consisted of 121 items and was available online at the website of the National Fibromyalgia Association.The table below shows the percentage use of different therapies for FM based on data from a 2012 study lead by Dr. Rebecca Robinson, a fibromyalgia researcher, and her colleagues. The study evaluated the burden of illness and treatment patterns for patients with fibromyalgia from July 2008 through May 2010 in 58 care settings in the United States, including Puerto Rico. A majority of the 91 physicians participating were either rheumatologists or primary care physicians. There were 1,700 patients with FM who were mostly female and white with a mean age of 50.4 years and duration of illness of 5.6 years. The study shows the burden of illness is high, patients were taking on average 2.6 medications concurrently to treat their FM and the treatments with the most evidence to support their use were not always the treatments most frequently chosen. Opioids were one of the most commonly used treatments, even though there is no evidence opioids are effective in treating FM related pain. The FDA issued a statement in February 2019 indicating the agency will be pushing for increased research and development of non-addictive, non-opioid chronic pain treatments.&#8203; The chart below comes from an observational study in 2013 led by Dr. Rebecca Robinson. Researchers assessed the 12-month treatment patterns and outcomes for patients starting a new medication for FM in actual clinical practice. Data from 1,700 patients was collected at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months using a regression model. Patients were started on 145 unique drugs and over 75% took two or more medications concurrently for FM at each time point assessed. The most common reason for discontinuation was adverse events (63.4%) followed by lack of efficacy (30.3%). This study shows that adverse events can have an impact on adhering to medications used chronically to treat FM.&#8203; The polypharmacy (both indicated and off-label medications) utilized by patients to manage their FM symptoms, along with a demonstrated lack of adherence to currently approved FDA treatments reflect side effects and\/or lack of efficacy of currently available drugs and treatments. It also indicates a very significant unmet medical need, with associated cost burden to payers and loss of productivity of patients. With the exception of IMC-1, we are not aware of any drugs currently in development and directed at the management of FM that deploy an antiviral mechanism(s) of action. Current products are used to ameliorate FM symptoms rather than address an underlying cause(s) of the disease. In contrast, the mechanism of action of IMC-1 targets a potential underlying, root cause of FM: HSV-1 reactivation.Clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions. As a result, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. However, generally speaking, in clinical trials the discontinuation rate for the three CNS-mediated, FDA approved drugs, is approximately twice that of patients treated with placebo. This is important as inability to tolerate a medicine can lead to discontinuation of therapy.Our Novel Mechanism of Action (&#8220;MOA&#8221;)Scientists and clinicians agree that patients with FM have a problem with central pain processing. The exact causality of the heightened pain sensitivity in FM is poorly understood. What is generally agreed is that the central sensitization seen in FM is secondary to a combination of genetic and environmental factors that render the patient susceptible to developing the widespread chronic pain and related symptoms seen in FM. We believe that, when FM patients are exposed to significant life stressors, be they physical or emotional, it results in an abnormal stress or herpes virus mediated-immune response. Herpes viruses are unique in that they remain in a dormant state (latency) in neuronal nuclei as nonintegrated, circular DNA associated with nucleosomes, with recurrent reactivations for the life of the host. We believe it is likely that nerve resident viral herpetic reactivation is necessary for the nociceptive response seen in FM. This cyclical process of virus reactivation and lytic infection of HSV-1 is postulated to perpetuate FM symptoms in these patients.Our novel therapeutic is directed at interrupting the ongoing immune response by suppressing HSV-1, which suppresses the abnormal stress response, thereby alleviating the central pain processing abnormality and other FM symptoms. Studies have shown that neither antivirals nor COX-2\/NSAIDS taken alone result in a meaningful clinical benefit. However, when administered in combination, the synergistic response was unexpected and promising. This IMC-1 synergistic response resulted from a combination of famciclovir inhibiting viral DNA polymerase and celecoxib inhibiting upregulation of COX-2 (and to a lesser extent COX-1). There have been multiple published studies using NSAIDS\/COX-2&#8217;s in the treatment of FM. According to a 2017 review published in the Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews, NSAIDs\/COX-2&#8217;s alone where shown to be no more effective than placebo in treating pain associated with FM. Products included in the review were ibuprofen 2400mg daily, naproxen 1000mg daily, tenoxicam 20mg daily and COX-2 etoricoxib 90mg daily. Antiviral monotherapy treatment of FM was studied by Dr. Sally A. Kendall and her colleagues and published in 2004 in the Journal of Rheumatology. Dr. Kendall evaluated valacyclovir 1 gram three times a day vs placebo in 60 patients with FM. The results showed no difference in change of pain between valacyclovir and placebo.Virally induced upregulation of COX enzymes is important for efficient viral replication. An article published by Dr. Lynn W. Enquist, a professor at Princeton University, and his colleagues in the Journal of Virology (2004), demonstrated that many herpes viruses, including HSV-1, significantly up-regulate COX-2 and to a lesser degree COX-1. In an article published by Yuehong Liu and colleagues in 2014 in The Scientific World Journal, they estimated 14-fold increase in COX-2, 1.8-fold increase in COX-1 during HSV-1 infection.Celecoxib inhibits COX-2 and to a lesser degree COX-1, both of which are critical to the replication and growth of live virions. In general, COX-2 inhibition is regarded as more important than COX-1 inhibition for the suppression of HSV-1 reactivation. COX-2 activation is involved in the induction of herpetic recurrences, and COX-2 inhibition is accompanied not only by a reduction of viral shedding, but also a reduction of viral DNA in nerve ganglia.The anti-herpes virus MOA of the nucleoside analogs (which include famciclovir) is well characterized and this drug class has been used to treat viruses over decades. In its active state famciclovir is initially phosphorylated to a monophosphate form, after which it is converted to penciclovir triphosphate by cellular kinases within virus-infected cells. Penciclovir triphosphate &#8212; the active moiety- competitively inhibits viral DNA polymerase, reducing viral DNA synthesis and replication. The specificity of penciclovir for viral DNA polymerase is an important contributor to its benign safety profile. Famciclovir interrupts DNA polymerase and, in combination with celecoxib, results in synergistic viral suppression. If definitively demonstrated through pivotal clinical trials, the efficacy, safety and tolerability, along with the combined MOA, would, we believe, differentiate IMC-1 from current standard of care and near-term pipeline drugs, while providing new opportunities in the treatment of other chronic pain conditions within the Somatic Symptom Disorders.Discovery and DevelopmentThe initial clinical evidence supporting the development of an antiviral plus COX-2\/NSAID combination to address FM was first derived through clinical observation in patients with IBS. IBS patients treated with famciclovir, who were serendipitously also placed on celecoxib to treat their arthritis, showed significant improvement not only in their IBS, but also FM, fatigue, and headaches. In particular, FM patients conveyed that they felt noticeably better when placed on the combination of famciclovir and celecoxib. We believe that stress and other environmental factors reactivate a persistent (indolent) HSV-1 infection, resulting in a continuous nociceptive stimulation and immune response. The cyclical process of virus reactivation and lytic infection of HSV-1 perpetuates FM symptoms. To interrupt and reverse viral reactivation and immune response, and resultant continuous nociceptive stimulation requires the suppression of HSV-1, reverting it into a dormant (latency) status. We believe the coaction (synergy) of therapeutic agents with different antiviral properties is required to suppress HSV-1 and reverse the symptoms of FM. Famciclovir, a nucleoside analog DNA inhibitor, inhibits the replication of viral DNA. HSV-1 upregulates COX-2, and to a lesser degree COX-1, and this upregulation of COX enzymes is critical for efficient viral replication. Celecoxib effectively blocks virally induced upregulation of COX enzymes, hence the combined activity of Famciclovir and Celecoxib results in the reversion of HSV-1 to latency.IMC-1 interrupts the chronic dysfunctional immune response to HSV-1 by suppressing viral replication and re-emergence from latency. This results in the suppression of the abnormal stress response seen in IBS and FM, thereby alleviating the central pain processing abnormality. Multiple published clinical studies have confirmed that neither antivirals (such as famciclovir) nor COX-2\/NSAIDs (such as celecoxib) administered singly deliver any meaningful clinical benefit. Based on Phase 2a results, the synergy of the fixed-dose combination of famciclovir and celecoxib (IMC-1) has potential as a FM therapy. If approved, this could differentiate IMC-1 from current standard of care and pipeline products and, we believe, alter treatment outcomes in FM, and potentially a number of other chronic pain conditions in the Somatic Symptom Disorders where HSV-1 may play a role.Biomarker &#8212; Gastrointestinal Tissue Study to see if HSV-1 is present in IBS\/FM&#8203; The stomach of FM patients is one of the few sites that presents an opportunity for biopsy of tissue to determine if FM patients are burdened with HSV-1 infection, where active FM is resultant upon reactivation of HSV-1 virus infection. We have postulated that HSV-1 infected nerve tissue located in the gastric mucosa provides a site for biopsy and represents an excellent site to confirm active HSV-1 infection in patients with recurrent active FM . To test this hypothesis, we engaged the University of Alabama to analyze GI biopsy tissue to search for active HSV-1 virus. Thirty patients with documented FM with chronic GI complaints had their stomach biopsied with samples sent to the University of Alabama for analysis by Carol Duffy PhD, University of Alabama virologist. Fifteen controls without chronic pain or FM and without chronic GI conditions were studied as the comparator arm to the open study. The GI biopsies were evaluated for HSV-1 infection by Immunoblot analysis for viral non-structural protein (ICP8) with PCR used to detect herpesvirus DNA sequence. ICP8 is only found during an active HSV-1 infection. A summary of this data is presented below.&#8203; The study found that 83% of patients with FM and chronic GI conditions had ICP8, a protein only found in active HSV-1 infections as demonstrated in the GI biopsy. While only 9% of control patients had ICP8 (p = 0.0001). The study also analyzed patients suffering from symptoms of IBS and demonstrates a strong correlation with HSV-1 (p = 0.0005) as well, when compared to controls. The correlation of HSV-1 activation to FM (and IBS) was shown and we believe corroborates the underlying mechanistic rationale for IMC-1. The study is not required to be submitted to the IND.PRID-201 Phase 2a Study of IMC-1 In Patients With Fibromyalgia (NCT01850420)PRID-201 Phase 2a Study DesignThe PRID-201 study represents the first placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of IMC-1. The Phase 2a clinical study involved 143 FM patients and a 16 -week, multicenter, double blind,randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2a proof of concept trial conducted under IND 114827. Randomized patients received either IMC-1 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IMC-1, as a single treatment for patients with primary FM. The primary efficacy outcome measure was a change from baseline in FM pain. FM pain was assessed using the 24-hour recall average pain score as recorded on the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (&#8220;NRS&#8221;) measure during clinic visits, as well as with the 7-day recall average pain score recorded on the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (&#8220;FIQ-R&#8221;). The safety and tolerability of treatment with IMC-1 was compared to placebo by analysis of vital signs, laboratory parameters, treatment-emergent adverse events (&#8220;TEAEs&#8221;), and discontinuation due to adverse events. A complete description of the study, including secondary and exploratory objectives, and results can be found in the PRID-201 Clinical Study Report submitted to the Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) on December 11, 2014 (Serial No. 0009).Patients completed the NRS for pain, revised FIQ-R, Beck Depression Inventory (&#8220;BDI-II&#8221;), Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (&#8220;MFI&#8221;), and the National Institutes of Health (&#8220;NIH&#8221;) Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (&#8220;PROMIS&#8221;) fatigue questionnaire at Baseline and Weeks 6, 12, and 16 (or early termination (&#8220;ET&#8221;)). Patients also completed a Patient Global Impression of Change (&#8220;PGIC&#8221;) questionnaire at Weeks 6, 12, and 16 (or ET).IMC-1 demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the chronic pain of the studied FM patients when measured by either metrics utilized in the study &#8212; the 24-hour recall data, or the 7-day pain recall. Additionally, this proof of concept study IMC-1 treated subjects reported significant improvements on overall global impression of change at the 12 and 16-week visits. Significant improvement in fatigue (PROMIS fatigue scale) and mood (BDI-II scale) were noted at endpoint.The primary outcome measure was based on change in patient-reported pain scores from baseline to week 16 of the study. IMC-1 treated subjects reported statistically significant better scores compared to placebo subjects, as summarized below. The two pain scales are very similar. The NRS scale measures pain over the last 24 hours on an 11-point numerical rating scale (from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst imaginable pain) that was recorded during clinic visits. The FIQ-R is a disease specific instrument designed to assess the impact of fibromyalgia on various aspects of the patient&#8217;s well-being. The symptom section of the FIQ-R asks the patient to rate their level of pain over the past 7 days using an 11-point numerical scale (from 0 = No Pain to 10 = Unbearable Pain).PRID-201 Phase 2a Primary Endpoint Analysis&#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Placebo LS &#8203; IMC-1 LS &#8203; &#8203; &#160;&#8203; &#160;&#8203; &#8203; Change @ &#8203; Change @ &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160;Pain Analysis &#160; Endpoint (SE) &#160; Endpoint (SE) &#160; Contrast (SE) &#160; P- Value NRS 24-hour recall, MMRM LOCF\/BOCF Imputation @ 16 weeks&#160;-1.1(0.28) &#160;-1.9(0.28) &#160;-0.8(0.37) &#160;0.031FIQ-R 7-days recall, MMRM LOCF\/BOCF Imputation @ 16 weeks&#160;-0.92(0.30) &#160;-2.2(0.30) &#160;-1.25(0.38) &#160;0.001&#8203; If the estimated change from baseline for a patient&#8217;s pain scores met or exceeded 50%, they were considered a 50% pain responder. In the pain responder analysis, a generalized linear regression curve fit was applied to an individual patient&#8217;s pain data. The high hurdle of 50% pain reduction from baseline is statistically significant at endpoint, pain outcome measures by 50% responder analysis are summarized below.PRID-201 Phase 2a Secondary Endpoint 50% Reduction of Pain Analyses with Curve Fit&#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Placebo &#8203; Placebo &#8203; IMC-1 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Responders &#160; Non-Responders &#160; Responders &#160; IMC-1 &#8203; &#8203; 50% Pain Responder Analysis &#160; Measure &#160; (%) &#160; (%) &#160; (%) &#160; Non-Responders &#160; P &#8209; Value Week 16 Visit, 50% Reduction&#160;NRS&#160;(15.1) &#160;(84.9)&#160;(30.3) &#160;(69.7) &#160;0.009 Week 16 Visit, 50% Reduction&#160;FIQ&#8209;R Pain&#160;(16.9) &#160;(83.1)&#160;(37.9) &#160;(62.1) &#160;0.001 &#8203; As shown in the chart below, the same analysis was performed for a 30% reduction in pain, and the results were statistically significant for the responders with 7-day recall but were not statistically significant for the 24-hour NRS.PRID-201 Phase 2a Secondary Endpoint 30% Reduction of Pain Analyses with Curve Fit&#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; &#8203; Placebo &#8203; Placebo &#8203; IMC-1 &#8203; &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Responders &#8203; Non-Responders &#8203; Responders &#8203; IMC-1 &#8203; &#8203; 30% Pain Responder Analysis &#160; Measure &#160; (%) &#160; (%) &#160; (%) &#160; Non-Responders &#160; P-Value Week 16 Visit, 30% Reduction&#160;NRS&#160;(31.5) &#160;(68.5) &#160;(42.4) &#160;(57.6) &#160;0.052 Week 16 Visit, 30% Reduction&#160;FIQ-R Pain&#160;(28.2) &#160;(71.8) &#160;(43.9) &#160;(56.1) &#160;0.012 &#8203; Past studies of FM treatment have indicated that the Patient Global Interpretation Change (PGIC) scale is a sensitive measure for detecting therapeutic benefit. While it tends to correlate most closely with pain results, the PGIC can be viewed as a patient&#8217;s assessment of overall therapeutic benefit of the therapy in question. The PGIC outcome measure was pre-specified as a key secondary endpoint. The PGIC responder analysis (see below) was significant at the 6, 12, and 16-week visits.PRID-201 Phase 2a Secondary Endpoint Patient Global Impression of Change Result&#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Placebo &#8203; Placebo &#8203; IMC-1 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Responders &#8203; Non &#8209; Responders &#8203; Responders &#8203; IMC-1 &#8203; &#8203; PGIC Analysis &#160;(%) &#160;(%) &#160;(%) &#160;Non &#8209; Responders &#160;P- Value Week 6 Visit&#160;(19.2) &#160;(80.8) &#160;(37.7) &#160;(62.3) &#160;0.040 Week 12 Visit&#160;(17.8) &#160;(82.2) &#160;(37.7) &#160;(62.3) &#160;0.005 Week 16 Visit&#160;(19.2) &#160;(80.8) &#160;(33.3) &#160;(66.6) &#160;0.040 &#8203; FIQ-R total score change was significant as was the PROMIS Fatigue inventory, both of which evidence that IMC-1 does more than just modify the perception of pain. The FIQ-R total score is a composite of all questions from all three domains (Functional, Overall Impact and Symptoms). Fatigue was assessed in both the PROMIS fatigue score and the MFI total score. In the statistical analyses, the reductions from Baseline to Week 16 were numerically greater in the IMC-1 group than in the placebo group, and reached statistical significance for the reduction in fatigue score in the PROMIS assessment (LS mean change of -2.68 vs. -6.65, p=0.001) but not in the MFI total score assessment (LS mean change -3.69 vs. -6.90, p=0.107).PRID-201 Phase 2a Secondary Endpoint Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised &#38; PROMIS Fatigue Results&#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160;&#8203; Placebo &#8203; IMC &#8209; 1 &#8203; Placebo LS &#8203; IMC &#8209; 1 LS &#8203; &#160;&#8203; &#160;&#160;Outcomes Measure &#160;Method &#160;Baseline &#160;Baseline &#160;Change (SE) &#160;Change (SE) &#160;Contrast (SE) &#160;P &#8209; Value FIQ-R&#160;Week 16 MMRM LOCF\/BOCF&#160;56.81 (73) &#160;54.28 (69) &#160;-7.87(2.33) &#160;-17.54(2.40) &#160;-9.67(3.05) &#8203; 0.002 PROMIS Fatigue&#160;Week 16 MMRM LOCF\/BOCF&#160;65.83 (73) &#160;65.55 (69) &#160;-2.68(0.93) &#160;-6.65(0.96) &#160;-3.96(1.22) &#8203; 0.001 &#8203; The FIQ-R demonstrated statistical significance in all 3 domains (see below).Analysis of FIQ-R Domain Scores with LOCF\/BOCF Imputation&#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Week 16 &#8203; LS Mean (SE) Change from Baseline &#8203; &#160;&#8203; &#8203; &#160;FIQ-R Analysis &#8203; Placebo &#8203; IMC &#8209; 1 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; LOCF\/BOCF Imputation)* &#160; N = 71 &#160; N = 66 &#160; Contrast (SE) &#160; P- Value** Functional Domain&#160;-5.44(2.32) &#160;-14.29(2.40) &#160;-8.85(3.03) &#160;0.004 Overall Impact Domain&#160;-1.89(0.61) &#160;-4.29(0.63) &#160;-2.40(0.79) &#160;0.003 Symptoms Domain&#160;-7.90(2.33) &#160;-16.77(2.40) &#160;-8.88(3.06) &#160;0.004 * LOCF\/BOCF imputation = BOCF for missing data due to withdrawals related to adverse events or lack of efficacy or LOCF for missing data unrelated to efficacy or adverse events.** Obtained from MMRM model with treatment as the main effect, and investigative site and Baseline score as covariates.Use of Rescue MedicationTramadol use was prospectively identified as the only rescue therapy by IMC. The proportion of patients taking tramadol for fibromyalgia rescue was defined as all tramadol usage from the concomitant medication logs. The proportion of patients who took rescue therapy for fibromyalgia was summarized by treatment group. The use of tramadol was significantly higher in the placebo group compared to the IMC-1 group.IMC-1 exhibited consistent improvement across several secondary FM treatment outcomes, including functional assessments, lower fatigue, increased time to rescue medication and improvements in FM patient&#8217;s global health status, as reflected in the table below.&#8203; PRID-201 Phase 2a SafetyTolerability of IMC-1 was better than placebo in Study PRID-201 (P2a). As shown below, many of the treatment-emergent adverse event categories, including gastrointestinal, were reported more frequently in the placebo group and are actually symptoms of FM. No serious unexpected adverse events were noted in this study. There were no deaths during the study and only 3 serious adverse events (&#8220;SAEs&#8221;) were reported. The 2 in the IMC-1 group were a Non-ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction and a Facial Cellulitis and 1 in the placebo group was a right breast micro-metastatic ductal carcinoma. One of the 3 SAEs was considered possibly related to study treatment &#8212; the non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction that occurred early in the study in a 47-year-old patient treated with IMC-1. The causal relationship of this SAE to treatment with IMC-1 cannot be ruled out; however, the patient&#8217;s underlying coronary artery disease and strong family history of premature cardiac disease suggest that other causal factors were also involved.PRID-201 Phase 2a Adverse Event ReportAdverse Events Reported for &#8805;5% of the Patients in Either Treatment Group&#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Placebo &#8203; IMC &#8209; 1 &#160; Adverse Event &#160; N=73 &#160; N=69 &#160; Any Event&#160;(78.1) % (72.5) %Headache&#160;(13.7) % (11.6) %Urinary Tract Infection&#160;(5.5) % (8.7) %Blood Lactate Dehydrogenase Increased&#160;(1.4) % (5.8) %Nasopharyngitis&#160;(1.4) % (5.8) %Diarrhea&#160;(12.3) % (4.3) %Nausea&#160;(17.8) % (4.3) %Fibromyalgia&#160;(5.5) % (2.9) %Vomiting&#160;(6.8) % (2.9) %&#8203; Adverse Events Reported for &#8805;5% of the Patients in Either Treatment Group&#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Placebo &#8203; IMC &#8209; 1 Adverse Event &#160; N=73 &#160; N=69 Constipation&#160;(8.2) % &#8212; Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease&#160;(5.5) % &#8212; Alopecia&#160;(5.5) % &#8212; Oropharyngeal Pain&#160;(5.5) % &#8212; &#8203; In PRID-201 Phase 2a, as seen in the chart below, more patients in the placebo group (16.2%; n=12) discontinued therapy due to adverse events than on IMC-1 (5.8%; n=4). Increased treatment adherence in actual clinical practice is important in any chronic therapy.&#8203; The lack of adherence to currently available treatments is indicative of the significant need for more effective and better tolerated therapies. Patients and physicians suggest that an ideal treatment would have fewer side effects and address the pervasive symptoms of FM including chronic fatigue; chronic fatigue was one of the three key factors of an ideal FM product that was discussed at the FM PFDD meeting. The preliminary clinical evidence reported suggests the potential for IMC-1 to address an unmet medical need by first treating an underlying cause, and thereby the symptoms of FM. IMC-1 also has the potential to improve safety and tolerability through more manageable rates of adverse reactions and consequently improving efficacy through improved adherence by FM patients.IMC-1 Phase 2a End of Study Blinded QuestionnaireAn end of study questionnaire analysis was included as an exploratory instrument in this Phase 2a study. It simply asked the patients whether they had suffered any conditions listed below which are commonly associated with FM, and if so, how their symptoms were now relative to baseline. The likelihood of improvement versus placebo was measured for patients on IMC-1 in the blinded &#8220;End of PRID-201 Phase 2a Trial&#8221; Questionnaire; data listed below:&#9679; FM and Chronic Fatigue: 2.2 times (improvement vs placebo) &#9679; IBS: 2.8 times &#9679; Brain Fog (cognitive impairment): 2.1 times &#9679; Headache: 2.5 times &#9679; TMJ: 5 times &#9679; Insomnia: 1.7 times &#9679; Neck and back pain: 2.3 times &#9679; Anxiety: 2.8 times &#9679; Depression: 1.6 times &#8203; This information was gathered as exploratory data to inform future research. For example, patients who were on IMC-1 and had IBS symptoms were 2.8 times more likely to be improved compared to placebo. IBS is one of the indications we may explore for future IMC-1 clinical trials.Regulatory and Development TimelineWe have regularly engaged the FDA on IMC-1 for the treatment of FM. The FDA has provided the following guidance with respect to the development of IMC-1 for the treatment of FM. Since we are combining proprietary doses of two previously-approved drugs, our fixed dose combination product candidate is eligible for submission to the FDA for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by, or for, the applicant and on which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The 505(b)(2) application enables us to reference published literature and\/or the FDA&#8217;s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for previously-approved drugs with the same active ingredient. Under Section 505(b)(2), we plan to rely upon FDA&#8217;s previous findings of safety and effectiveness, and extensively reference several sections of the US Prescribing Information for Famvir (famciclovir), from Novartis, and Celebrex (celecoxib), from Pfizer, the reference drugs for our program. The 505(b)(2) NDA filing will rely on portions of the development programs conducted by the sponsors of the reference drugs, as described in the FDA-approved US Prescribing Information.At the conclusion of our phase 2a clinical trial in 2017 we held an end-of-phase 2 meeting with the FDA and conducted a subsequent conference call with the FDA in November 2017. As a result of those meetings the FDA has provided us with a defined path forward to Phase 3, including agreement to initiate a Phase 2b and\/or Phase 3 trial after we provide animal toxicology study data, conduct a human PK study with celecoxib and famciclovir combined in 1 tablet. (which has been completed) and submit the phase 2b clinical trial protocol that includes monitoring renal function through standard safety labs to the FDA.The human PK study on the new tablet, using a three-way crossover study design, has been successfully completed. IMC-1 performed as expected in the human PK study, with no drug-drug interactions and no reported adverse events. Multiple dose PK of IMC-1 has been well characterized and provides additional data to better understand the PK profile of IMC-1.We have also successfully completed the required 90-day sub-chronic toxicology studies with the oral combination of IMC-1 that we believe support the optimal dosing to be used in the Phase 2b and Phase 3 trials. This GLP 13-week general toxicology study with toxico-kinetics and a recovery period has been completed, as has a 13-week GLP study of embryo-fetal development in rats, including using higher famciclovir doses. There were no unexpected toxicities form INC-1 (all toxicities shown were consistent with the known toxicities of the individual reference drugs &#8211; celecoxib and famciclovir). Based on its review of prior 90-day and chronic toxicology studies, the FDA is requesting that we assess long term testicular and kidney toxicity in our chronic toxicology studies.In order to support chronic long term dosing with IMC-1, we are planning for the required chronic toxicology studies will be run in parallel to the Phase 2b trial. These studies consist of a six-month rat and a nine-month dog study. The development of the IMC-1 tablet formulation and manufacture was completed at Frontida (Aurora, IL) along with the ongoing stability data (18-month stability data completed). The IMC-1 prototype tablet, completed at Catalent, had excellent 24-month stability.The FDA has agreed to our 505(b)(2) filing plan.The Phase 2b FM trial is expected to start in the first quarter of 2021 with topline results by the second quarter of 2022. The multifactorial Phase 3 trial is planned to start immediately following the Phase 2b trial results. The Phase 2b trial design is exhibited below.Phase 2b Study Design and Timeline&#8203; Market and CompetitionThe three pharmaceutical agents currently approved for the treatment of fibromyalgia, pregabalin (Lyrica), duloxetine (Cymbalta) and milnacipran (Savella) are all associated with significant adverse events, and limited clinical efficacy. Despite this, Lyrica and Cymbalta together had peak sales of approximately $10 billion across all of their approved indications, with Lyrica achieving $3.6 billion in the US in 2018, including sales related to FM. Reflecting the need for more effective and better tolerated treatments, a large number of additional products are also prescribed that are not indicated for FM. The American Academy of Rheumatology and FDA, strongly recommends to avoid opioid narcotic medications for treating fibromyalgia. Evidence shows these drugs are not of helpful to most people with fibromyalgia, and will cause greater pain sensitivity or make pain persist. Despite that, research shows that FM patients are prescribed opioids as part of their treatment regimen.According to the National Fibromyalgia &#38; Chronic Pain Association, approximately 10 million Americans and 3% &#8211; 6% of people worldwide are afflicted with FM. Common chronic pain conditions affect approximately 116 million adults in the U.S. at a cost of $560 &#8211; $635 billion annually in direct medical treatment costs and lost productivity. This estimate combines the incremental cost of health care ($261-$300 billion) and the cost of lost productivity ($299 &#8211; $335 billion), more than heart disease or cancer. Competitive late stage FM pipeline products are not disruptive to the current standard of care, nor do they appear to address the root cause of the disease.We conducted a commercial opportunity assessment in each of 2014 and 2020 to better understand the medical needs existing in the FM treatment market and to quantify the addressable market opportunity for a potential new FDA approved FM treatment.Our 2014 assessment reviewed the competitive landscape for the treatment of FM, including physician demographic information, patient demographic information, current &#38; potential future treatment projections, and obtained information from high prescribing physicians and primary research with six healthcare payors as well as conducted a revenue forecast.Our recently completed 2020 assessment provided an updated disease review, forecast and valuation for FM and IBS for the US and Ex-US markets. Both assessments show that significant unmet medical needs exist in the fibromyalgia treatment armamentarium, as well as the IBS treatment armamentarium, highlighting the commercial potential for a new medicine that proves to be safe and effective as determined by the FDA.Primary Research BackgroundIn our 2014 assessment 75 physicians were surveyed, targeting high volume prescribers in key geographies and practice settings (rheumatologists, pain specialists, neurologists, primary care) across the US. Also, eight high prescribing key opinion leader physicians (KOLs) were interviewed to gain qualitative insights into the treatment paradigm for FM and related disorders. Additionally, six payors were interviewed to determine their receptivity to IMC-1 as a first line treatment, how price sensitive these payors would be, how likely they would be to reimburse IMC-1, and whether Medicare would cover IMC-1.This primary research confirmed the large unmet medical need in the treatment of FM. The researchers found that physicians and patients, express a need for additional, safer and more efficacious FM therapy options. The 2014 assessment found that only 15% of the 75 physicians surveyed expressed satisfaction with their current FM treatment options and none responded as being &#8220;very satisfied&#8221;. Ninety five percent of physicians surveyed indicated the available standard of care treatments only manage symptoms and did not treat the cause of the disease.Physician Satisfaction with Available FM Therapies (n=75)&#8203; Physicians paralleled the concerns described by the patients at FDA&#8217;s PFDD meeting indicating that the currently FDA approved therapies have many of the associated adverse events such as dizziness, nausea or vomiting, weight gain, dry mouth, sleeplessness, restlessness, peripheral edema, chronic headaches, IBS symptoms and suicidal thoughts or actions. The six payors interviewed confirmed FM to be a serious disease with patients routinely consuming substantial healthcare resources. IMC-1, with proprietary dosing (dosing cannot be replicated by generic products), a unique antiviral MOA with Fast Track status, can be expected to receive favorable pricing and formulary coverage and a high level of unmet need exists because the underlying cause is not well understood and treatment is patchwork.Secondary Research: FM PipelineBoth of our 2014 and 2020 assessments analyzed historical markets for FM and related disorders and identified key players and trends. They also created competitive intelligence on all in-line and pipeline FM treatments, including ongoing US clinical trials. It is worth noting that the mechanistic approach for all of these potential new treatment candidates is complementary to the antiviral IMC-1 mechanistic approach, thus not true competitors to IMC-1, presuming continued success.Other Market OpportunitiesEach of the 2014 and 2020 assessment confirmed that FM represents an unmet medical need with a large market opportunity and that IMC-1 is a differentiated product. Overall, the assessment found that physicians are not satisfied with current FM treatments, that the etiology and cause of FM remains poorly understood, and that current products only manage the symptoms of FM. We believe our paradigm changing discovery that HSV-1 could play an important role in the pathogenesis of FM which we believe was confirmed in our Phase 2a trial, with wide scale clinical utility to be further examined and tested in our planned Phase 2b trial. If successfully proven, we believe that IMC-1 can be disruptive to the market and can change the way FM is treated. The 2020 assessment showed IMC-1&#8217;s novel MOA and positive Phase 2a results differentiate it mechanistically from current and pipeline FM products. Importantly, the 2014 assessment with 6 health insurance payors has confirmed potential first-line usage and favorable pricing and access potential.Intellectual PropertyWe strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that we believe are important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and our product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business.As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio of owned patents totaled 20 issued patents consisting of 12 issued U.S. patents and 8 issued foreign patents. This includes three Composition of Matter patents, including a Synergistic Patent, and two Method of Use patents in the US, all of which relate to IMC-1. Exclusivity with all patents is through 2033.Issued US IMC-1 Patents&#9679; U.S. &#8220;Composition of Matter&#8221; Patents (US 8,809,351 &#38; US 10,034,846) Drug-combination of famciclovir and celecoxib &#9679; U.S. &#8220;Method-of-Use&#8221; Patent (US 9,040,546) Famciclovir + celecoxib for the treatment of FM (fibromyalgia), CFS or IBS &#9679; U.S. &#8220;Method-of-Use&#8221; Patent (US 9,173,863) Method of dispensing famciclovir + celecoxib in a regimen to treat Functional Somatic Syndrome conditions &#9679; U.S. &#8220;Composition of Matter&#8221; Synergistic Patent (US 10,251,853) Synergistic combination for total daily dose of famciclovir and celecoxib Issued Foreign IMC-1 Patents&#9679; European Patent (EP 2 811 833 &#38; 2 965 759) &#9679; Japan (JP 5855770 &#38; 6422848) &#9679; Australia (AU 2013217110) &#9679; China (CN 104144606) &#9679; Korea (KR 10-1485748) &#9679; Canada (2,863,812) US Patents Covering Other Anti-Viral Combinations&#9679; US 9,682,051 (acyclovir\/meloxicam) &#9679; US 8,623,882 (acyclovir\/diclofenac) &#9679; US 9,259,405 (famciclovir\/diclofenac) &#9679; US 9,642,824 (valacyclovir\/diclofenac) &#9679; US 9,980,932 (valacyclovir\/meloxicam) &#9679; US 10,543,184 (acyclovir\/celecoxib) &#9679; US 10,632,087 (famciclovir\/meloxicam) Foreign Patents Covering Other Anti-Viral Combinations&#9679; Europe Patent (EP 2 965 759) Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our collaborators and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.We have also been granted additional US and EU patents, representing all possible combinations of targeted antivirals and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs\/COX-2s) containing appropriate COX-2 &#38; COX-1 inhibition. At present, we are developing only IMC-1 (famciclovir\/celecoxib) with the other patents being obtained to increase the therapeutic combinations that we may explore in the future to treat other virally medicated illnesses.Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties have prepared and filed patent applications prior to March 16, 2013 in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO, to determine priority of invention. For more information, please see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.&#8221;Material AgreementsIn 2012, we entered into a Know-How License Agreement, or the License Agreement, with the University of Alabama. In consideration for the License Agreement, the University of Alabama received membership interests representing 10% of the issued membership interests at that time. The License Agreement is in effect for 25 years and will terminate on June 1, 2037. Under the License Agreement, we were granted a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to utilize, including the right to sublicense and sell products incorporating, the know-how, technical information, and data related and pertaining to the herpesvirus biology, including herpesvirus replication mechanisms, modes of action of anti-herpesvirus medications, and sensitivity and accuracy of herpesvirus diagnostic tests, any of which were developed by UA under the direction of Dr. Carol Duffy before the effective date of the License Agreement, all of which is defined as the Technical Information. The University of Alabama reserved the right to use the Technical Information for educational, research, clinical, and other non-commercial purposes. We may assign the license to any purchaser or transferee of substantially all of our assets.Sales and MarketingIf IMC-1 is approved, we plan to enter into sales and marketing agreements with one or several pharmaceutical companies to sell to neurologists, geriatric specialists and to primary care physicians.ManufacturingWe rely on third-party contractors for manufacturing clinical supplies and plan to do so for commercial amounts also. Presently we are working with an overseas supplier for the manufacture of the cGMP API and with a local supplier for the storage stability, encapsulating, blister packing, blinding and distribution of the capsules or pills to the clinical sites.Government RegulationThe FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.U.S. Government Regulation of Drug ProductsIn the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:&#9679; Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations. &#9679; Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. &#9679; Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated. &#9679; Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication. &#9679; Submission to the FDA of an NDA. &#9679; Satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable. &#9679; Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity. &#9679; Satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data. &#9679; Payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA. &#9679; Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies. Preclinical StudiesPreclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to initiate.Clinical TrialsClinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it initiates at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:&#9679; Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. &#9679; Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. &#9679; Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.Marketing ApprovalAssuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of &#8220;filing&#8221; of a standard NDA, for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a &#8220;filing&#8221; decision.In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and\/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#8217;s continued safety, quality and purity.The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug&#8217;s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval ProgramsThe FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, these six- and ten-month review periods are measured from the &#8220;filing&#8221; date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.In addition, products tested for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a &#8220;breakthrough therapy.&#8221; A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.Accelerated Approval PathwayThe FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug influences a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug.The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor&#8217;s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug&#8217;s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.Orphan Drug Designation and ExclusivityUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an &#8220;orphan drug&#8221; if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will be receiving orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease if the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.Post-Approval RequirementsDrugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products.The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments and list their marketed drug products with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.Once an approval of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:&#9679; Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls. &#9679; Fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials. &#9679; Refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals. &#9679; Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products. &#9679; Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs or devices may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.U.S. Coverage and ReimbursementSignificant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of our product candidate, IMC-1, or any other for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the U.S. will depend in part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by payors.The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary, which might not include all the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or another alternative is available. Medicare Part D, Medicare&#8217;s outpatient prescription drug benefit, contains protections to ensure coverage and reimbursement for oral oncology products, and all Part D prescription drug plans are required to cover substantially all oral anti-cancer agents. However, a payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Private payors often rely on the lead of the governmental payors in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Sales of IMC-1 or any other candidates will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by third-party payors. Achieving favorable coverage and reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) and\/or the Medicare Administrative Contractors is typically a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product.Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, we may need to conduct studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development.U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance RequirementsWe are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our operations include:&#9679; the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value; &#9679; federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent; &#9679; provisions of HIPAA, which created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and &#9679; the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and report to CMS payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer. Many states have their own Sunshine laws governing the tracking and reporting of payments to healthcare providers. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments and Generic CompetitionSection 505(b)(2) NDAsAs an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA.Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA and enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA&#8217;s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA&#8217;s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical studies or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the reference drug has been approved or for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.ANDA Approval ProcessThe Hatch-Waxman Amendments also established an abbreviated FDA approval process for drugs that are shown to be bioequivalent to drugs previously approved by the FDA through the NDA process. Approval to market and distribute these drugs is obtained by filing an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, with the FDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, a generic applicant must demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#8220;generic equivalents&#8221; to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.Orange Book ListingIn seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant&#8217;s product. Upon approval, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA&#8217;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA, as applicable, that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a &#8220;section viii&#8221; statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding a patented method-of-use that is approved for the reference drug, rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.If within 45 days of receipt of a Paragraph IV Notification the NDA holder for the reference drug and\/or patent owners initiates a patent infringement lawsuit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification (the 30-Month Stay), expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit with a finding of patent invalidity or non-infringement, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant.The ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.Non-Patent ExclusivityIn addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. A fixed combination drug product may receive NCE exclusivity if one of its active ingredients is an NCE, but not if all of its active ingredients have previously been approved. An &#8220;active moiety&#8221; is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance&#8217;s physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA&#8217;s findings regarding that drug, except that the FDA may accept such an application for filing after four years if the application includes a paragraph IV certification to a listed patent. In the case of such applications accepted for filing between four and five years after approval of the reference drug, a 30-Month Stay of approval triggered by a timely patent infringement lawsuit is extended by the amount of time necessary to extend the stay until 7-1\/2 years after the approval of the reference drug NDA.A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical trials (other than bioavailability studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted\/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the exclusivity period.Regulation Outside the United StatesTo the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.To market our future products in the EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:&#9679; The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and &#9679; National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA assess the risk-benefit balance of the product based on scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.Data and Marketing ExclusivityIn the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.Orphan Drug DesignationIn the EEA, a medicinal product can be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in development. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.In the EEA, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, the EMA or the member state competent authorities, cannot accept another application for a marketing authorization, or grant a marketing authorization, for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for medicines that have also complied with an agreed PIP.This period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of &#8220;clinical superiority&#8221; by a similar medicinal product, or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a member state in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for incentives made available by the EU and its Member States to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan drugs.Human Capital ResourcesAs of December 31, 2020, we had three full-time employees.

Services and itineraries provided by our company include custom packages according to the client&#8217;s specifications. We develop and offer our own sailing tours in the North part of Dominican Republic as well as third-party suppliers.&#160;","27":" ITEM 1. BUSINESS FORMATION OF OUR COMPANY We are an externally managed non-diversified closed-end management investment company incorporated in Maryland that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (&#8220;BDC&#8221;) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;1940 Act&#8221;). We commenced operations on May 24, 2013 and completed our initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) on September 30, 2013. We are managed by Mount Logan Management LLC, an investment adviser that is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Advisers Act&#8221;), and BC Partners Management LLC provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated, and intend to comply with the requirements to continue to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company (&#8220;RIC&#8221;) under subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We offer customized financing to business owners, management teams and financial sponsors for change of ownership transactions, recapitalizations, strategic acquisitions, business expansion and other growth initiatives. We invest in first lien loans, and, to a lesser extent, second lien loans and equity securities issued by lower middle-market and traditional middle-market companies. We were formed for the purpose of: (i) acquiring, through a series of transactions, an investment portfolio from the following entities: CapitalSouth Partners Fund I Limited Partnership (&#8220;Fund I&#8221;); CapitalSouth Partners Fund II Limited Partnership (&#8220;Fund II&#8221;); CapitalSouth Partners Fund III, L.P. (&#8220;Fund III Parent&#8221;); CapitalSouth Fund III, L.P. (f\/k\/a CapitalSouth Partners SBIC Fund III, L.P.) (&#8220;Fund III&#8221;) and CapitalSouth Partners Florida Sidecar Fund I, L.P. (&#8220;Florida Sidecar&#8221; and, collectively with Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and Fund III Parent, the &#8220;Legacy Funds&#8221;); (ii) raising capital in the IPO and (iii) continuing and expanding the business of the Legacy Funds by making additional debt and equity investments in lower middle-market and traditional middle-market companies. On September 24, 2013, we acquired 100% of the limited partnership interests in Fund II, Fund III and Florida Sidecar and each of their respective general partners, as well as certain assets from Fund I and Fund III Parent, in exchange for an aggregate of 8,974,420 shares of our common stock (the &#8220;Formation Transactions&#8221;). Fund II, Fund III and Florida Sidecar became our wholly owned subsidiaries. Fund II and Fund III retained their small business investment company (&#8220;SBIC&#8221;) licenses, continued to hold their existing investments at the time of the IPO and have continued to make new investments. The IPO consisted of the sale of 4,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $20.00 per share resulting in net proceeds to us of $74.25 million, after deducting underwriting fees and commissions totaling $4.0 million and offering expenses totaling $1.75 million. The other costs of the IPO were borne by the limited partners of the Legacy Funds. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Florida Sidecar transferred all of its assets to us, and was legally dissolved as a standalone partnership. On March 1, 2019, Fund II repaid its outstanding debentures guaranteed by the SBA (&#8220;SBA-guaranteed debentures&#8221;) and relinquished its SBIC license. On June 10, 2021, Fund III repaid its SBA-guaranteed debentures and relinquished its SBIC license. As of December 31, 2021, there were no SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. The Company has formed and expects to continue to form certain consolidated taxable subsidiaries (the &#8220;Taxable Subsidiaries&#8221;), which are taxed as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These Taxable Subsidiaries allow the Company to make equity investments in companies organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements of a RIC under the Code. Capitala Business Lending, LLC (&#8220;CBL&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, was established on October 30, 2020, for the sole purpose of holding certain investments pledged as collateral under a senior secured revolving credit agreement with KeyBank National Association (the &#8220;KeyBank Credit Facility&#8221;). The financial statements of CBL are consolidated with those of Logan Ridge Finance Corporation. &#160; Reverse Stock Split On July 30, 2020, the Company&#8217;s board of directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) approved a one-for-six reverse stock split of the Company&#8217;s shares of common stock. Accordingly, on August 3, 2020, the Company filed Articles of Amendment (the &#8220;Articles of Amendment&#8221;) to its Articles of Amendment and Restatement with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland to effectuate a one-for-six reverse stock split (the &#8220;Reverse Stock Split&#8221;) of the Company&#8217;s shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the &#8220;Shares&#8221;). The Reverse Stock Split became effective at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on August 21, 2020 (the &#8220;Effective Time&#8221;). At the Effective Time, every six (6) issued and outstanding Shares were converted into one (1) Share. The Articles of Amendment also provided that there was no change in the par value of $0.01 per Share as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. No fractional shares of common stock were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split and fractional shares of common stock were eliminated by paying cash for the fair value of a fractional portion of Shares. The Reverse Stock Split applied to all of the Company&#8217;s outstanding Shares and therefore did not affect any shareholder&#8217;s relative ownership percentage. Definitive Agreement On April 20, 2021, Capitala Investment Advisors, LLC (&#8220;Capitala&#8221;), the Company&#8217;s former investment adviser, entered into a definitive agreement (the &#8220;Definitive Agreement&#8221;) with the Investment Advisor and Mount Logan Capital Inc. (&#8220;MLC&#8221;), both affiliates of BC Partners Advisors L.P. (&#8220;BC Partners&#8221;) for U.S. regulatory purposes, whereby Mount Logan acquired certain assets related to Capitala&#8217;s business of providing investment management services to the Company (the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;), through which the Investment Advisor became the Company&#8217;s investment adviser pursuant to an investment advisory agreement (the &#8220;Investment Advisory Agreement&#8221;) with the Company. At a special meeting of the Company&#8217;s stockholders (the &#8220;Special Meeting&#8221;) held on May 27, 2021, the Company&#8217;s stockholders approved the Investment Advisory Agreement. The transactions contemplated by the Definitive Agreement closed on July 1, 2021 (the &#8220;Closing&#8221;). As part of the Transaction, the Investment Advisor entered into a two-year contractual fee waiver (the &#8220;Fee Waiver&#8221;) with the Company to waive, to the extent necessary, any capital gains fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement that exceeds what would have been paid to Capitala in the aggregate over such two-year period under the prior advisory agreement. On the date of the Closing, the Company changed its name from Capitala Finance Corp. to Logan Ridge Finance Corporation and on July 2, 2021, the Company&#8217;s common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol &#8220;LRFC.&#8221; On July 1, 2021, in connection with the Closing, the Company&#8217;s then-current interested directors and the Company&#8217;s then-current independent directors resigned as members of the Board and Ted Goldthorpe, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, along with Alexander Duka, George Grunebaum, and Robert Warshauer, were appointed as members of the Board (the &#8220;Directors&#8221;). The Directors were appointed by the Board to fill the vacancies created by the resignations described above and the Directors were appointed to the class of directors as determined by the Board in accordance with the Company&#8217;s organizational documents. The Company&#8217;s stockholders will have the opportunity to vote for each of the Directors when his class of directors is up for reelection. All of the Company&#8217;s then-current officers resigned at the Closing and the Board appointed Ted Goldthorpe as the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and President, Jason Roos as the Company&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, Patrick Schafer as the Company&#8217;s Chief Investment Officer and David Held as the Company&#8217;s Chief Compliance Officer. On November 9, 2021, Jason Roos was replaced as Secretary and Treasurer of the Company by Brandon Satoren, who was also appointed as Chief Accounting Officer. Mr. Roos continues to serve as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. &#160; SUMMARY RISK FACTORS The risk factors described below are a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us. These are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other reports and documents filed by us with the SEC. Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure &#8226; Our financial condition and results of operations depend on our ability to effectively manage and deploy capital. &#8226; We depend upon Mount Logan Management LLC&#8217;s key personnel for our future success. &#8226; We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses. &#8226; Any inability of Mount Logan Management LLC to maintain or develop strong referral relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business. &#8226; Any failure on our part to maintain our status as a BDC would reduce our operating flexibility. &#8226; Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to raise additional capital and the way in which we do so. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage. &#8226; We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us, and the calculation of our base management fee, which is based upon our gross assets, may have the effect of encouraging our Investment Advisor to utilize leverage when it may not be advisable to do so. &#8226; A disruption in the capital markets and the credit markets could impair our ability to raise capital and negatively affect our business. &#8226; Adverse developments in the credit markets may impair our ability to secure debt financing. &#8226; Inflation may adversely affect our business and operations and those of our portfolio companies. &#8226; Disruptions to the global supply chain may have adverse impact on our portfolio companies and, in turn, harm us. &#8226; We will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax if we are unable to qualify or maintain our RIC tax treatment under the Code. &#8226; Mount Logan Management LLC is not obligated to reimburse us for any part of the incentive fee it receives that is based on accrued income that we never receive. &#8226; Our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance, public disclosure and accounting requirements that are costly and could adversely affect our business and financial results. &#8226; Internal and external cyber threats, as well as other disasters, could impair our ability to conduct business effectively. &#8226; Economic sanction laws in the United States and other jurisdictions may prohibit us and our affiliates from transacting with certain countries, individuals and companies. &#8226; Events outside of our control, including public health crises, could negatively affect our portfolio companies and our results of our operations. Risks Related to our Investments &#8226; Our investments are very risky and highly speculative. &#8226; An investment strategy focused primarily on smaller privately held companies involves a high degree of risk and presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies, a dependence on the talents and efforts of only a few key portfolio company personnel and a greater vulnerability to economic downturns. &#8226; Our investments in leveraged portfolio companies may be risky, and you could lose all or part of your investment. &#8226; The health and performance of our portfolio companies could be adversely affected by political and economic conditions in the countries in which they conduct business. &#8226; We are currently operating in a period of capital markets disruption and economic uncertainty. &#8226; The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business. &#8226; Our failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our portfolio. &#8226; Our ability to enter into new transactions with our affiliates, and to restructure or exit our investments in portfolio companies that we are deemed to &#8220;control&#8221; under the 1940 Act, will be restricted by the 1940 Act, which may limit the scope of investment opportunities available to us. &#8226; Our portfolio may lack diversification among portfolio companies, which may subject us to a risk of significant loss if one or more of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt instruments. &#8226; We are a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, and therefore we are not limited with respect to the proportion of our assets that may be invested in securities of a single issuer. &#8226; Our portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of industries, which may subject us to a risk of significant loss if there is a downturn in a particular industry in which a number of our investments are concentrated. &#8226; Defaults by our portfolio companies will harm our operating results. &#8226; If our portfolio companies are unable to protect their proprietary, technological and other intellectual property rights, our business and prospects could be harmed, and if portfolio companies are required to devote significant resources to protecting their intellectual property rights, the value of our investment could be reduced. &#8226; Any unrealized depreciation we experience on our loan portfolio may be an indication of future realized losses, which could reduce our income available for distribution. &#8226; Prepayments of our debt investments by our portfolio companies could adversely impact our results of operations and reduce our return on equity. &#160; &#8226; We may not realize gains from our equity investments. &#8226; Changes relating to the LIBOR calculation process may adversely affect the value of our portfolio of LIBOR-indexed, floating-rate debt securities. &#8226; We may choose to waive or defer enforcement of covenants in the debt securities held in our portfolio, which may cause us to lose all or part of our investment in these companies. &#8226; Our investments in securities rated below investment grade are speculative in nature and are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default, illiquidity of the security, and changes in value based on changes in interest rates. &#8226; Our investments may be in portfolio companies which may have limited operating histories and financial resources. Risks Relating to Our Securities &#8226; The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. &#8226; Our business and operation could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of investment strategy and impact our stock price. &#8226; Investing in our common stock may involve an above average degree of risk. &#8226; We cannot assure you that the market price of shares of our common stock will not decline. &#8226; Our common stockholders will bear the expenses associated with our borrowings, and the holders of our debt securities will have certain rights senior to our common stockholders. &#8226; Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. &#8226; Shares of our common stock have traded at a discount from net asset value and may do so in the future. &#8226; If the current period of capital market disruption and instability continues for an extended period of time, there is a risk that investors in our equity securities may not receive distributions consistent with historical levels or at all or that our distributions may not grow over time and a portion of our distributions may be a return of capital. &#8226; You may not receive distributions, or our distributions may decline or may not grow over time, and you will experience dilution in your ownership percentage if you opt out of our dividend reinvestment plan. &#8226; We will have broad discretion over the use of proceeds of any successful offering of securities. &#8226; The net asset value per share of our common stock may be diluted if we sell shares of our common stock in one or more offerings at prices below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock. &#8226; Your interest in Logan Ridge may be diluted if you do not fully exercise your subscription rights in any rights offering. &#8226; If we issue preferred stock, the net asset value and market value of our common stock will likely become more volatile. &#8226; Holders of any preferred stock we might issue would have the right to elect members of our Board and class voting rights on certain matters. OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We expect the companies in which we invest will generally have between $5 million and $50 million in trailing twelve-month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;). We believe our focus on direct lending to private companies enables us to receive higher interest rates and more substantial equity participation. As part of that strategy, we may invest in first lien loans, which have a first priority security interest in all or some of the borrower&#8217;s assets. In addition, our first lien loans may include positions in &#8220;stretch&#8221; senior secured loans, also referred to as &#8220;unitranche&#8221; loans, which combine characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien loans, providing us with greater influence and security in the primary collateral of a borrower and potentially mitigating loss of principal should a borrower default. We also may invest in second lien loans, which have a second priority security interest in all or substantially all of the borrower&#8217;s assets. In addition to debt securities, we may acquire equity or detachable equity-related interests (including warrants) from a borrower. Typically, the debt in which we invest is not initially rated by any rating agency; however, we believe that if such investments were rated, they would be rated below investment grade. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as &#8220;high yield&#8221; or &#8220;junk,&#8221; have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer&#8217;s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. We intend to target investments that mature in four to six years from our investment. We typically will not limit the size of our loan commitments to a specific percentage of a borrower&#8217;s assets that serve as collateral for our loan, although we attempt to protect against risk of loss on our debt investments by structuring, underwriting and pricing loans based on anticipated cash flows of our borrowers. OUR INVESTMENT ADVISOR We are managed by the Investment Advisor, whose investment team members have significant and diverse experience financing, advising, operating and investing in lower middle-market and traditional middle-market companies. Mount Logan was formed in 2020 and is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Mount Logan is controlled by MLC, a publicly listed Canada-based alternative asset management company. Mount Logan is an affiliate of BC Partners for U.S. regulatory purposes and BC Partners provides Mount Logan with personnel pursuant to a resource sharing agreement, which allows Mount Logan to utilize the resources of BC Partners' broader credit team. MLC is managed by the founders of BC Partners Credit bringing to bear the investment expertise and deep resources of the broader BC Partners platform, all of which the Company - as an entity within the BC Partners ecosystem - benefits from. Mount Logan provides investment management services to privately offered investment funds and acts as the collateral manager to issuers of collateralized loan obligations (&#34;CLOs&#34;) backed by debt obligations and similar assets. Mount Logan's investment committee, or the Mount Logan Investment Committee, includes Ted Goldthorpe, Matthias Ederer, Henry Wang and Raymond Svider, each experienced members of Mount Logan's investment personnel. With approximately $40 billion in assets under management and offices in London, Paris, Hamburg, and New York, the BC Partners organization is comprised of a private equity platform, a credit platform, and a real estate platform. All three platforms operate as integrated businesses within the overall BC Partners organization. Founded in 1986, BC Partners grew and evolved with the development of the European private equity market, consistently maintaining its position as one of the leading &#160; buyout firms in the region. It subsequently expanded investment operations to North America to support larger transactions operating more globally and established a successful investment platform for buyouts of businesses based in the United States and around the world. BC Partners expanded its strategic offering by establishing a credit platform in 2017 and a real estate platform in 2018. BC Partners has a 35-year investing track record across a variety of geographies and sectors. Throughout its investment history, BC Partners has built strong and longstanding relationships with global institutional investors. To the extent permitted by the 1940 Act and interpretation of the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;), the Investment Advisor and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Investment Advisor or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, and consistent with the Investment Advisor&#8217;s allocation procedures. On October 23, 2018, the SEC issued an order granting an application for exemptive relief to an affiliate of our Investment Advisor that allows BDCs managed by the Investment Advisor, including Logan Ridge, to co-invest, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, in certain private placement transactions, with other funds managed by the Investment Advisor or its affiliates, including BCP Special Opportunities Fund I LP, BC Partners Lending Corporation and any future funds that are advised by the Investment Advisor or its affiliated investment advisers. Pursuant to the Order, we are permitted to co-invest in such investment opportunities with our affiliates if a &#8216;&#8216;required majority&#8217;&#8217; (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our directors each of which is not considered an &#8220;interested person&#8221;, as such term is defined under the 1940 Act (the &#8220;independent directors&#8221;) make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our then-current investment objective and strategies. INVESTMENTS We will engage in various investment strategies from time to time in order to achieve our overall lending and investment objectives. Our strategies will generally require current cash yields and sensible leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and either a first or second lien position (subject to limited instances in which we will not obtain security) in the collateral of the portfolio company. The strategy we select will depend upon, among other things, market opportunities, the skills and experience of our Investment Advisor&#8217;s investment team, the result of our financial, operational and strategic evaluation of the opportunity, and our overall portfolio composition. Most of our existing debt investments offer, and we expect most of our future debt investments will offer, the opportunity to participate in a borrower&#8217;s equity performance through warrant participation, direct equity ownership or otherwise, and many of our debt investments will require the borrower to pay an early termination fee. Collectively, these attributes have been, and are expected to be, important contributors to the returns generated by our Investment Advisor&#8217;s investment team. The Investment Advisor&#8217;s investment team uses a disciplined investment portfolio monitoring and risk management process that emphasizes strict underwriting standards and guidelines, strong due diligence investigation, regular portfolio review, analysis and performance-guided responses, and proper investment diversification. We allocate capital among different industries, geographies and private equity sponsors on the basis of relative risk\/reward profiles as a function of their associated downside risk, volatility, perceived fundamental risk and our ability to obtain favorable investment protection terms. Types of Investments We will target debt investments that yield meaningful current income and, in many cases, provide the opportunity for capital appreciation through equity securities. In each case, the following criteria and guidelines are applied to the review of a potential investment; however, not all criteria are met in every single investment in our portfolio, nor do we guarantee that all criteria will be met in the investments we will make in the future. &#8226; Established Companies With Positive Cash Flow. We seek to invest in established companies with a history of generating revenues and positive cash flows. We intend to focus on companies with a history of profitability and minimum trailing twelve-month EBITDA of between $5 million and $50 million. We do not intend to invest in start-up companies, distressed or &#8220;turn-around&#8221; situations or companies with business plans that we do not understand. &#8226; Experienced Management Teams with Meaningful Investment. We seek to invest in companies in which senior or key managers have significant company or industry-level experience and have significant equity ownership. It has been our experience that these management teams are more committed to the company&#8217;s success and more likely to manage the company in a manner that protects our debt and equity investments. &#8226; Significant Invested Capital. We believe that the existence of an appropriate amount of equity beneath our debt capital provides valuable support for our investment. In addition, the degree to which the particular investment is a meaningful one for the portfolio company&#8217;s financial sponsor, and the financial sponsor&#8217;s ability and willingness to invest additional equity capital as and to the extent necessary, are also important considerations. &#8226; Appropriate Capital Structures. We seek to invest in companies that are appropriately capitalized. First, we examine the amount of equity that is being invested by the company&#8217;s private equity sponsor to determine whether there is a sufficient capital cushion beneath our invested capital. We also analyze the amount of leverage and the characteristics of senior debt with lien priority over our investment. &#8226; Strong Competitive Position. We intend to invest in companies that have developed strong, defensible product or service offerings within their respective market segments. These companies should be well positioned to capitalize on organic and strategic growth opportunities and should compete in industries with strong fundamentals and meaningful barriers to entry. We further analyze prospective portfolio investments in order to identify competitive advantages within their respective industries, which may result in superior operating margins or industry-leading growth. &#8226; Customer and Supplier Diversification. We expect to invest in companies with sufficiently diverse customer and supplier bases. We believe these companies will be better able to endure industry consolidation, economic contraction and increased competition than those that are not sufficiently diversified. However, we also recognize that from time to time, an attractive investment opportunity with some concentration among its customer base or supply chain will present itself. We believe that concentration issues can be evaluated and, in some instances (whether due to supplier or customer product or platform diversification, the existence and quality of long-term agreements with such customers or suppliers or other select factors), mitigated, thus presenting a superior risk-adjusted pricing scenario. Debt Investments The Investment Advisor&#8217;s investment team tailors the terms of each debt investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction, the needs of the prospective portfolio company and, as applicable, its financial sponsor, negotiating a structure that seeks to protect our rights and manage our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan. We expect our primary source of return to be the cash interest we will collect on our debt investments. We also typically &#160; seek board observation rights with each portfolio company, and we offer (and have historically provided) managerial and strategic assistance to these companies. We seek to further protect invested principal by negotiating appropriate affirmative, negative and financial covenants in our debt documents that are conservative enough to represent a prudent cushion at closing or to budgeted projections, but that are flexible enough to afford our portfolio companies and their financial sponsors sufficient latitude to allow them to grow their businesses. Typical covenants include default triggers and remedies (including penalties), lien protection, leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios, change of control provisions and put rights. Most of our debt investments feature call protection to enhance our total return on debt investments that are repaid prior to maturity. Most of our debt investments are structured as first lien loans, and as of December 31, 2021, 73.6% of the fair value of our debt investments consisted of such investments. First lien loans may contain some minimum amount of principal amortization, excess cash flow sweep feature, prepayment penalties, or any combination of the foregoing. First lien loans are secured by a first priority lien in existing and future assets of the borrower and may take the form of term loans, delayed draw facilities, or revolving credit facilities. In some cases, first lien loans may be subordinated, solely with respect to the payment of cash interest, to an asset based revolving credit facility. Unitranche debt, a form of first lien loan, typically involves issuing one debt security that blends the risk and return profiles of both senior secured and subordinated debt in one debt security, bifurcating the loan into a first-out tranche and last-out tranche. As of December 31, 2021, 8.5% of the fair value of our first lien loans consisted of last-out loans. We believe that unitranche debt can be attractive for many lower middle-market and traditional middle-market businesses, given the reduced structural complexity, single lender interface and elimination of intercreditor or potential agency conflicts among lenders. We may also invest in debt instruments structured as second lien loans. Second lien loans are loans which have a second priority security interest in all or substantially all of the borrower&#8217;s assets, and in some cases, may be subject to the interruption of cash interest payments upon certain events of default, at the discretion of the first lien lender. On a fair market value basis, 22.6% of our debt investments consisted of second lien loans as of December 31, 2021. Some of our debt investments have payment-in-kind (&#8220;PIK&#8221;) interest, which is a form of interest that is not paid currently in cash but is accrued and added to the loan balance until paid at the end of the term. While we generally seek to minimize the percentage of our fixed return that is in the form of PIK interest, we sometimes receive PIK interest due to prevailing market conditions that do not support the overall blended interest yield on our debt investments being paid in all-cash interest. As of December 31, 2021, our weighted average PIK yield was 0.1%. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average annualized cash yield on our debt portfolio was 9.4%. In addition to yield in the form of current cash and PIK interest, some of our debt investments include an equity component, such as a warrant to purchase a common equity interest in the borrower for a nominal price. The weighted annualized yield is calculated based on the effective interest rate as of period end, divided by the fair value of our debt investments. The weighted average annualized yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our fees and expenses. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level. Equity Investments When we make a debt investment, we may be granted equity participation in the form of detachable warrants to purchase common equity in the company in the same class of security that the owners or equity sponsors receive upon funding. In addition, we may make non-control equity co-investments in conjunction with a loan transaction with a borrower. The Investment Advisor&#8217;s investment team generally seeks to structure our equity investments, such as direct equity co-investments, to provide us with minority rights provisions and, to the extent available, event-driven put rights. They also seek to obtain limited registration rights in connection with these investments, which may include &#8220;piggyback&#8221; registration rights. In addition to warrants and equity co-investments, our debt investments in the future may contain a synthetic equity position. INVESTMENT PROCESS The management of our investment portfolio is the responsibility of Mount Logan and the Logan Ridge investment team (the &#34;LRFC Investment Team&#34;). All investment decisions require the majority approval of the Mount Logan Investment Committee. The LRFC Investment Team sources, identifies and diligences investment opportunities and presents the opportunity to the Mount Logan Investment Committee for approval. The Mount Logan Investment Committee is currently comprised of three members of BC Partners Credit (&#34;BCP Credit&#34;) (Ted Goldthorpe, Matthias Ederer and Henry Wang), and one member of BC Partners Private Equity (Raymond Svider). The Mount Logan Investment Committee meets regularly to review the opportunities presented by the LRFC Investment Team. Follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies may require the Mount Logan's Investment Committee approval beyond that obtained when the initial investment in the company was made. In addition, temporary investments, such as those in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less, may require approval by the Mount Logan Investment Committee. The Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors, oversees and monitors the investment performance and, beginning with the second anniversary of the effective date of the Investment Advisory Agreement, will annually review the compensation Logan Ridge pays to Mount Logan. None of Mount Logan's investment professionals receive any direct compensation from Logan Ridge in connection with the management of Logan Ridge's portfolio. The following individuals (the &#34;LRFC Portfolio Managers&#34;) have senior responsibility for the management of our investment portfolio: Ted Goldthorpe, Matthias Ederer, Henry Wang, Raymond Svider and Patrick Schafer. Mr. Schafer is Logan Ridge's Chief lnvestment Officer and has primary responsibility for the day-to-day implementation and management of Logan Ridge's investment portfolio. The stages of our investment selection process are as follows: Deal Generation\/Origination Deal generation and origination is maximized through long-standing and extensive relationships with industry contacts, brokers, commercial and investment bankers, entrepreneurs, service providers (such as lawyers and accountants), as well as current and former clients, portfolio companies and investors. Screening All potential investments that are received are screened for suitability and consistency with our investment criteria (see &#8220;&#8212; Due Diligence and Underwriting,&#8221; below). In screening potential investments, our Investment Advisor&#8217;s investment team utilizes the same value-oriented investment philosophy they employed in their &#160; work with the Legacy Funds and commits resources to managing downside exposure. If a potential investment meets our basic investment criteria, a deal team is assigned to perform preliminary due diligence. In doing so, we consider some or all of the following factors: &#8226; A comprehensive financial model that we prepare based on quantitative analysis of historical financial performance, financial projections made by management or the financial sponsor, and pro forma financial ratios assuming an investment consistent with possible structures. In analyzing our model, we test various investment structures, pricing options, downside scenarios and other sensitivities in order to better understand potential risks and possible financial covenant ratios; &#8226; The competitive landscape and industry dynamics impacting the potential portfolio company; &#8226; Strengths and weaknesses of the potential investment&#8217;s business strategy and industry outlook; and &#8226; Results of a broad qualitative analysis of the company&#8217;s products or services, market position and outlook, customers, suppliers and quality of management. If the results of this preliminary due diligence are satisfactory, the deal team prepares an executive summary that is presented to our Investment Advisor&#8217;s investment committee in a meeting that includes all members of the portfolio and investment teams. This executive summary includes the following areas: &#8226; Company history and summary of product(s) and\/or service(s); &#8226; An overview of investors, anticipated capital sources and transaction timing; &#8226; Investment structure and expected returns, including initial projected financial ratios; &#8226; Analysis of historical financial results and key assumptions; &#8226; Analysis of the company&#8217;s business strategy; &#8226; Analysis of the financial sponsor&#8217;s relevant experience or expected strategy; &#8226; Investment strengths, weaknesses and priority issues to be addressed in due diligence; and &#8226; Pro forma capitalization and ownership. If our investment committee recommends moving forward, we will issue a non-binding term sheet or indication of interest to the potential portfolio company and, when applicable, its financial sponsor. If a term sheet is successfully negotiated, we will begin more formal due diligence and underwriting as we progress towards the ultimate investment approval and closing. Due Diligence and Underwriting The completion of due diligence deliverables is led by at least two investment professionals. However, all investment and portfolio team members are regularly updated with due diligence progress, especially any issues that emerge. The investment professionals leading the due diligence efforts are typically assigned to the original deal team that worked on the executive summary. However, post-term sheet deal teams sometimes contain one or more additional investment professionals and may include other professionals from business development, portfolio or other areas if a particular skill or experience set would be especially valuable in the due diligence process. The members of the underwriting team complete due diligence and analyze the relationships among the prospective portfolio company&#8217;s business plan, operations and expected financial performance. Due diligence consists of some or all of the following: &#8226; On-site visits with management and relevant key employees; &#8226; In-depth review of historical and projected financial statements, including covenant calculation work sheets; &#8226; Interviews with customers and suppliers; &#8226; Management background checks; &#8226; Review of reports by third-party accountants, outside counsel and other industry, operational or financial experts, whether retained by us or the financial sponsor; &#8226; Review of material contracts; and &#8226; Review of financial sponsor&#8217;s due diligence package and internal executive summaries. Typically, we utilize outside experts to analyze the legal affairs, accounting systems and financial results and, where appropriate, we engage specialists to investigate certain issues. During the underwriting process, significant, ongoing attention is devoted to sensitivity analyses regarding whether a company might bear a significant &#8220;downside&#8221; case and remain profitable and in compliance with assumed financial covenants. These &#8220;downside&#8221; scenarios typically involve assumptions regarding the loss of key customers and\/or suppliers, an economic downturn, adverse regulatory changes and other relevant stressors that we attempt to simulate in our quantitative and qualitative analyses. Further, we continually examine the effect of these scenarios on financial ratios and other metrics. During the underwriting process, the executive summary that was completed for the initial investment committee presentation is expanded upon into a full diligence memo and key findings are presented at subsequent, weekly meetings of the investment committee for continued discussion and, to the extent applicable, the investment committee issues new instructions to the underwriting team from the investment committee. Approval, Documentation and Closing The underwriting team for the proposed investment presents the full diligence memo and key findings from due diligence to the investment committee on an ongoing basis. Prior to the commencement of documentation, approval from the investment committee is sought and, if approved, the underwriting professionals heretofore involved proceed to documentation. At all times during the documentation process, the underwriting professionals who conducted the due diligence remain involved; likewise, all extensively negotiated documentation decisions are made by the lead underwriting team member, in accordance with input from at least one investment committee member and guidance from outside counsel. As and to the extent necessary, key documentation challenges are brought before the investment committee for prompt discussion and resolution. Upon the completion of satisfactory documentation and the satisfaction of closing conditions, final approval is sought from the investment committee before closing and funding. &#160; &#160; ONGOING RELATIONSHIPS WITH PORTFOLIO COMPANIES Monitoring Our Investment Advisor monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. We generally require our portfolio companies to provide annual audited financial statements and quarterly unaudited financial statements, in each case, with management discussion and analysis and covenant compliance certificates, and monthly unaudited financial statements. Using the monthly financial statements, we calculate and evaluate all financial covenants and additional financial coverage ratios that might not be part of our covenant package in the loan documents. For purposes of analyzing a portfolio company&#8217;s financial performance, we may adjust their financial statements to reflect pro forma results in the event of a recent change of control, sale, acquisition or anticipated cost savings. Our Investment Advisor has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, including the following: &#8226; Assessment of success in adhering to each portfolio company&#8217;s business plan and compliance with covenants; &#8226; Periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; &#8226; Comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; &#8226; Attendance at and participation in the board meetings; and &#8226; Review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. AGREEMENTS Investment Advisory Agreement On July 1, 2021, the Company entered into an investment advisory agreement (the &#8220;Investment Advisory Agreement&#8221;) with the Investment Advisor, which was approved by the Company&#8217;s stockholders on May 27, 2021. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect until July 1, 2023, a period of two years from the date it first became effective and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by the Board or by a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, by a majority of our directors who are not &#34;interested persons&#34; as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (&#34;Independent Directors&#34;). Subject to the overall supervision of the Board, the Investment Advisor manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory and management services to us. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Investment Advisor: &#8226; determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio, and the manner of implementing such changes; &#8226; identifies, evaluates, and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies); &#8226; closes and monitors the investments we make; and &#8226; provides us with other investment advisory, research, and related services as we may from time to time require. The Investment Advisor&#8217;s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith, or negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, the Investment Advisor and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members, and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from the Company for any damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our Investment Advisor&#8217;s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as Investment Advisor for the Company. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company has agreed to pay the Investment Advisor a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components &#8212; a base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of the gross assets, which are the total assets reflected on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and includes any borrowings for investment purposes. Although the Company does not anticipate making significant investments in derivative financial instruments, the fair value of any such investments, which will not necessarily equal their notional value, will be included in the calculation of gross assets. For services rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of the gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. The incentive fee consists of the following two parts: The first part of the incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income, and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, diligence, and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement to our Administrator, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, computed net of all realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a hurdle of 2.0% per quarter (8.0% annualized). The Company pays the Investment Advisor an incentive fee with respect to the pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: &#8226; no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle of 2.0%; &#8226; 100% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle but is less than 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized). The Company refers to this portion of the pre-incentive fee net investment income &#160; (which exceeds the hurdle but is less than 2.5%) as the &#8220;catch-up.&#8221; The &#8220;catch-up&#8221; is meant to provide the Investment Advisor with 20% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle did not apply if this net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter; and &#8226; 20% of the amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized) is payable to the Investment Advisor (once the hurdle is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 20% of all pre-incentive fee investment income thereafter is allocated to the Investment Advisor). The second part of the incentive fee will be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year, commencing on December 31, 2021, and will equal 20.0% of the Company&#8217;s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis with respect to each of the investments in the Company&#8217;s portfolio from the fiscal quarter ending on or immediately prior to July 1, 2021 through the end of each calendar year beginning with the calendar year ending December 31, 2021, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis from September 30, 2021 through the end of each calendar year beginning with the calendar year ending December 31, 2021, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Any realized capital gains, realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation with respect to the Company&#8217;s portfolio as of the end of the fiscal quarter ending on or immediately prior to July 1, 2021 shall be excluded from the calculations of the capital gains fee. In the event that the Investment Advisory Agreement shall terminate as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date shall be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying a capital gains fee. The Company will defer cash payment of the portion of any incentive fee otherwise earned by the Investment Advisor that would, when taken together with all other incentive fees paid to the Investment Advisor during the most recent 12 full calendar month period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made, exceed 20% of the sum of (a) the pre-incentive fee net investment income during such period, (b) the net unrealized appreciation or depreciation during such period and (c) the net realized capital gains or losses during such period. Any deferred incentive fees will be carried over for payment in subsequent calculation periods to the extent such payment is payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had incentive fees payable to the Investment Advisor of zero and $3.7 million related to fees earned in prior years but deferred under the incentive fee deferral mechanism. The Investment Advisor entered into a two-year contractual fee waiver (the &#8220;Fee Waiver&#8221;) with the Company to waive, to the extent necessary, any capital gains fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement that exceeds what would have been paid to our prior investment advisor, Capitala Investment Advisors, LLC, in the aggregate over such two-year period under the prior advisory agreement. Graphical Representation and Examples under the Investment Advisory Agreement The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee: Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Net Investment Income Pre-incentive fee net investment income (expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) &#160;Percentage of pre-incentive fee net investment income allocated to the Mount Logan Management LLC These calculations are appropriately pro-rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. You should be aware that a rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle rate and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to our Investment Advisor with respect to pre-incentive fee net investment income. Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation under the Investment Advisory Agreement Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee* Alternative 1: Assumptions Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25% Hurdle rate (1) = 2.0% Management fee (2) = 0.50% Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20% Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#8722; (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.55% Pre-incentive net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no incentive fee. Alternative 2: Assumptions Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.9% &#160; Hurdle rate (1) = 2.0% Management fee (2) = 0.50% Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20% Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#8722; (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.2% &#160;Incentive fee &#160;&#160;= 100% &#215; pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to the &#8220;catch-up&#8221; (4) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;= 100% &#215; (2.2% &#8722; 2.0%) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;= 0.20% &#160;Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, but does not fully satisfy the &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision, therefore the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.20%. Alternative 3: Assumptions Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.50% Hurdle rate (1) = 2.0% Management fee (2) = 0.50% Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20% Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#8722; (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.80% Incentive fee &#160;&#160;= 20% &#215; pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to &#8220;catch-up&#8221; (4) &#160;Incentive fee &#160;&#160;= 100% &#215; &#8220;catch-up&#8221; + (20% &#215; (pre-incentive fee net investment income &#8722; 2.5%)) &#160;Catch-up &#160;&#160;= 2.5% &#8722; 2.0% &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;= 0.5% &#160;Incentive fee &#160;&#160;= (100% &#215; 0.5%) + (20% &#215; (2.80% &#8722; 2.5%)) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;= 0.5% + (20%&#215; 0.3%) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;= 0.5% + 0.06% &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;= 0.56% &#160;Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, and fully satisfies the &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision, therefore the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.56%. &#160; *The hypothetical amount of pre-incentive fee net investment income shown is based on a percentage of total net assets. (1) Represents 8.0% annualized hurdle rate. (2) Represents 2.00% annualized management fee. (3) Excludes organizational and offering expenses. (4) The &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision is intended to provide the Investment Advisor with an incentive fee of 20% on all of Logan Ridge&#8217;s pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when its net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter. Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee Alternative 1: Assumptions &#8226; Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (&#8220;Investment A&#8221;), and $30 million investment made in Company B (&#8220;Investment B&#8221;) &#8226; Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million and fair market value (&#8220;FMV&#8221;) of Investment B determined to be $32 million &#8226; Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million &#8226; Year 4: Investment B sold for $31 million The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be: &#8226; Year 1: None &#160; &#8226; Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $6 million ($30 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20%) &#8226; Year 3: None $5 million (20% multiplied by ($30 million cumulative capital gains less $5 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $6 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2). &#8226; Year 4: Capital gains incentive fee of $200,000 $6.2 million ($31 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20%) less $6 million (capital gains fee taken in Year 2). Alternative 2: Assumptions &#8226; Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (&#8220;Investment A&#8221;), $30 million investment made in Company B (&#8220;Investment B&#8221;) and $25 million investment made in Company C (&#8220;Investment C&#8221;) &#8226; Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $25 million &#8226; Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $27 million and Investment C sold for $30 million &#8226; Year 4: FMV of Investment B determined to be $24 million &#8226; Year 5: Investment B sold for $20 million The capital gains incentive fee, if any, would be: &#8226; Year 1: None &#8226; Year 2: $5 million capital gains incentive fee 20% multiplied by $25 million ($30 million realized capital gains on Investment A less unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B). &#8226; Year 3: $1.4 million capital gains incentive fee (1) $6.4 million (20% multiplied by $32 million ($35 million cumulative realized capital gains less $3 million unrealized capital depreciation)) less $5 million capital gains fee received in Year 2. &#8226; Year 4: None &#8226; Year 5: None $5 million (20% multiplied by $25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $35 million less realized capital losses of $10 million)) less $6.4 million cumulative capital gains fee paid in Year 2 and Year 3. &#160; (1) As illustrated in Year 3 of Alternative 2 above, if the Company were to be wound up on a date other than December 31 of any year, the Company may have paid aggregate capital gain incentive fees that are more than the amount of such fees that would be payable if the Company had been wound up on December 31 of such year. Example 3: Application of the Incentive Fee Deferral Mechanism Assumptions &#8226; In each of Years 1 through 4 in this example pre-incentive fee net investment income equals $40.0 million per year, which we recognized evenly in each quarter of each year and paid quarterly. This amount exceeds the hurdle rate and the requirement of the &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision in each quarter of such year. As a result, the annual income related portion of the incentive fee before the application of the deferral mechanism in any year is $8.0 million ($40.0 million multiplied by 20%). All income-related incentive fees were paid quarterly in arrears. &#8226; In each year preceding Year 1, we did not generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses, no capital gain-related incentive fee was paid and there was no deferral of incentive fees. &#8226; Year 1: We did not generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses. &#8226; Year 2: We realized a $30.0 million capital gain and did not otherwise generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses. &#8226; Year 3: We recognized $5.0 million of unrealized capital depreciation and did not otherwise generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses. &#8226; Year 4: We realized a $6.0 million capital gain and did not otherwise generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses. &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; Income Related Incentive Fee Accrued Before Application of Deferral Mechanism &#160; Capital Gains Related Incentive Fee Accrued Before Application of Deferral Mechanism &#160; Incentive Fee Calculations &#160; Incentive Fees Paid and Deferred Year 1 &#160; $8.0 million ($40.0 million multiplied by 20%) &#160; None &#160; $8.0 million &#160; Incentive fees of $8.0 million paid; no incentive fees deferred Year 2 &#160; $8.0 million ($40.0 million multiplied by 20%) &#160; $6.0 million (20% of $30.0 million) &#160; $14.0 million &#160; Incentive fees of $14.0 million paid; no incentive fees deferred Year 3 &#160; $8.0 million ($40.0 million multiplied by 20%) &#160; None (20% of cumulative net capital gains of $25.0 million ($30.0 million in cumulative realized gains less $5.0 million in cumulative unrealized capital depreciation) less $6.0 million of capital gains fee paid in Year 2) &#160; $7.0 million (20% of the sum of (a) our pre-incentive fee net investment income, (b) our net unrealized appreciation or depreciation during such period and (c) our net realized capital gains or losses during Year 3) &#160; Incentive fees of $7.0 million paid; $8.0 million of incentive fees accrued but payment restricted to $7.0 million; $1.0 million of incentive fees deferred Year 4 &#160; $8.0 million ($40.0 million multiplied by 20%) &#160; $0.2 million (20% of cumulative net capital gains of $31.0 million ($36.0 million cumulative realized capital gains less $5.0 million cumulative unrealized capital depreciation) less $6.0 million of capital gains fee paid in Year 2) &#160; $8.2 million &#160; Incentive fees of $9.2 million paid ($8.2 million of incentive fees accrued in Year 4 plus $1.0 million of deferred incentive fees); no incentive fees deferred Prior Investment Advisory Agreement On September 24, 2013, the Company entered into an investment advisory agreement (the &#8220;Prior Investment Advisory Agreement&#8221;) with our Prior Investment Advisor, Capitala Investment Advisors, LLC (&#8220;Capitala&#8221;), which was initially approved by the Board on June 10, 2013. As described in our Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, filed on May 4, 2021, which is incorporated herein by reference, the terms of the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement are substantially the same as those contained in the Investment Advisory Agreement, other than the reset of the capital gains incentive fee lookback feature to the date when Mount Logan assumed management of the Company Our Prior Investment Advisor is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Subject to the overall supervision of our Board, our Prior Investment Advisor managed our day-to-day operations, and provided investment advisory and management services to us. Under the terms of our Prior Investment Advisory Agreement, the Prior Investment Advisor: &#8226; determined the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; &#8226; identified, evaluated and negotiated the structure of the investments we made (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies); &#8226; closed and monitored the investments we made; and &#8226; provided us with other investment advisory, research and related services as we may have from time to time required. The Prior Investment Advisor&#8217;s services under the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement were not exclusive, and it was free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us were not impaired. Pursuant to the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement, we agreed to pay the Prior Investment Advisor a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components &#8212; a base management fee and an incentive fee. Prior Management Fee The prior base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of our gross assets, which was our total assets as reflected on our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and included any borrowings for investment purposes. Although we did not anticipate making significant investments in derivative financial instruments, the fair value of any such investments, which would not necessarily equal their notional value, would be included in our calculation of gross assets. For services rendered under the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee was payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee was calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. Prior Incentive Fee The prior incentive fee consists of the following two parts: The first part of the prior incentive fee was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we received from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under an administration agreement between us and the prior administrator (the &#8220;Prior Administration Agreement&#8221;), and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the prior incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income did not include any realized capital gains, computed net of all realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, was compared &#160; to a hurdle of 2.0% per quarter (8.0% annualized). We paid the Prior Investment Advisor an incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: &#8226; no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income did not exceed the hurdle of 2.0%; &#8226; 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeded the hurdle but was less than 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized). We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeded the hurdle but was less than 2.5%) as the &#8220;catch-up.&#8221; The &#8220;catch-up&#8221; was meant to provide our Prior Investment Advisor with 20% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle did not apply if this net investment income exceeded 2.5% in any calendar quarter; and &#8226; 20% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeded 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized) was payable to the Prior Investment Advisor (once the hurdle was reached and the catch-up was achieved, 20% of all pre-incentive fee investment income thereafter was allocated to the Prior Investment Advisor). The second part of the prior incentive fee was determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and would equal 20% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees with respect to each of the investments in our portfolio. The Company would defer cash payment of the portion of any incentive fee otherwise earned by the Prior Investment Advisor that would, when taken together with all other prior incentive fees paid to the Prior Investment Advisor during the most recent 12 full calendar month period ending on or prior to the date such payment was to be made, exceed 20% of the sum of (a) the pre-incentive fee net investment income during such period, (b) the net unrealized appreciation or depreciation during such period and (c) the net realized capital gains or losses during such period. Any deferred incentive fees would be carried over for payment in subsequent calculation periods to the extent such payment was payable under the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement. The Prior Investment Advisor voluntarily agreed to waive all or such portion of the quarterly incentive fees earned by the Prior Investment Advisor that would otherwise cause our quarterly net investment income to be less than the distribution payments declared by our Board. Quarterly prior incentive fees were earned by the Prior Investment Advisor pursuant to the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement. Prior Incentive fees subject to the waiver could not exceed the amount of incentive fees earned during the period, as calculated on a quarterly basis. The Prior Investment Advisor would not be entitled to recoup any amount of prior incentive fees that it waived. The waiver was effective in the fourth quarter of 2015 and continued through termination of the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement. Payment of Our Expenses The investment team of our Investment Advisor and their respective staffs, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by the Investment Advisor. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation): &#8226; the cost of our organization; &#8226; the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; &#8226; the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of our shares and other securities; &#8226; interest payable on debt, if any, to finance our investments; &#8226; fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments (such as legal, accounting, and travel expenses incurred in connection with making investments), including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments and advisory fees; &#8226; transfer agent and custodial fees; &#8226; fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; &#8226; costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;1934 Act&#8221;), and other applicable federal and state securities laws, and ongoing stock exchange listing fees; &#8226; federal, state and local taxes; &#8226; independent directors&#8217; fees and expenses; &#8226; brokerage commissions; &#8226; costs of proxy statements, stockholders&#8217; reports and other communications with stockholders; &#8226; fidelity bond, directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance, errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; &#8226; direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, telephone and staff; &#8226; fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs; and &#8226; all other expenses incurred by either our Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under the Administration Agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by our Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions, and our allocable portion of any costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief compliance officer, our chief financial officer and their respective administrative support staff. Duration and Termination On July 1, 2021, the Company entered into an investment advisory agreement (the &#8220;Investment Advisory Agreement with the Investment Advisor, which was approved by the Company&#8217;s stockholders on May 27, 2021. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect until July 1, 2023, a period of two years from the date it first became effective and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by the Board or by a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, by a majority of our directors who are not &#8220; &#34;interested persons&#34; as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (&#34;Independent Directors&#34;). The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Investment Advisory Agreement may also be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days&#8217; written notice to the other party.

Prior Administration Agreement The Prior Administration Agreement was initially approved by the Board on June 10, 2013 (the &#8220;Prior Administration Agreement&#8221;) and signed on September 24, 2013. The principal executive offices of our Prior Administrator, Capitala Advisors Corp., are located at 4201 Congress Street, Suite 360, Charlotte, North Carolina 28209. The Prior Administrator, pursuant to a sub-administration agreement, engaged U.S. Bank Global Fund Services to act on behalf of the Prior Administrator in its performance of certain administrative services for us.

To the extent that our Prior Administrator outsourced any of its functions, we would pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without any incremental profit to our Prior Administrator. Stockholder approval was not required to amend the Prior Administration Agreement. Our Prior Administrator also provided administrative services to our Prior Investment Advisor. As a result, the Prior Investment Advisor would also reimburse our Prior Administrator for its allocable portion of our Prior Administrator&#8217;s overhead, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions for the Prior Investment Advisor, and its allocable portion of the compensation of any administrative support staff. The Prior Administration Agreement provided that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, our Prior Administrator and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it were entitled to indemnification from Logan Ridge for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our Prior Administrator&#8217;s services under the Prior Administration Agreement or otherwise as administrator for Logan Ridge. Prior License Agreement We entered into a license agreement with the Prior Investment Advisor pursuant to which the Prior Investment Advisor agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name &#8220;Capitala.&#8221; Under this agreement, we had a right to use the Capitala name for so long as the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement with the Prior Investment Advisor was in effect. Other than with respect to this limited license, we had no legal right to the &#8220;Capitala&#8221; name. &#160; Staffing Logan Ridge has no employees. The Company is externally managed by the Investment Advisor, an affiliate of BC Partners, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. Mr. Goldthorpe, an interested member of the Board, has a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the Investment Advisor. The Investment Advisor is a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The Adviser is an affiliate of BC Partners Advisors L.P. for U.S. regulatory purposes. MLC is the ultimate control person of the Investment Advisor. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, fees payable to the Investment Advisor equal (i) the Base Management Fee and (ii) the Incentive Fee. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect from year-to-year if approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares, and, in each case, a majority of the independent directors. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Administrator provides administrative services to the Company necessary for the operations of the Company, which include providing to the Company office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and such other services as the Administrator, subject to review by the Board, shall from time to time deem to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under the applicable Administration Agreement. The Administrator also provides to the Company portfolio collection functions for and is responsible for the financial and other records that the Company is required to maintain and prepares, prints and disseminates reports to the Company&#8217;s stockholders and reports and all other materials filed with the SEC. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, the Company reimburses the Administrator the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including the Company&#8217;s allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of its chief financial officer , and chief compliance officer , and their respective staffs. VALUATION PROCESS AND DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE We determine the net asset value of our investment portfolio each quarter by subtracting our total liabilities from the fair value of our gross assets. We conduct the valuation of our assets, pursuant to which our net asset value shall be determined, at all times consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;) and the 1940 Act. Our valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below: Securities for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange shall be valued at such price as of the closing price on the day of valuation. We may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value assets. When doing so, we determine whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to U.S. GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. If determined adequate, we use the quote obtained. Securities for which reliable market quotations are not readily available or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology or provides a valuation or methodology that, in the judgment of our Investment Advisor or the Board, does not represent fair value, which we expect will represent a substantial majority of the investments in our portfolio, shall be valued as follows: (i) each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment; (ii) preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with our senior management; (iii) independent third-party valuation firms engaged by, or on behalf of, the Board will conduct independent appraisals, review management&#8217;s preliminary valuations and prepare separate preliminary valuation conclusions on a selected basis such that each portfolio investment shall be independently reviewed at least annually (investments will not be selected for such review, however, if they (a) have a value as of the previous quarter of less than 1.0% of our gross assets as of the previous quarter, or (b) have a value as of the current quarter of less than 1.0% of our gross assets as of the previous quarter, after taking into account any repayment of principal during the current quarter); and (iv) the Board will discuss valuations and determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Advisor and, where appropriate, the respective third-party valuation firms. The recommendation of fair value will generally be based on the following factors, as relevant: &#8226; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; &#8226; the portfolio company&#8217;s ability to make payments; &#8226; the portfolio company&#8217;s earnings and discounted cash flow; &#8226; the markets in which the issuer does business; and &#8226; comparisons to publicly traded securities. Securities for which market quotations are not readily available or for which a pricing source is not sufficient may include, but are not limited to, the following: &#8226; private placements and restricted securities that do not have an active trading market; &#8226; securities whose trading has been suspended or for which market quotes are no longer available; &#8226; debt securities that have recently gone into default and for which there is no current market; &#8226; securities whose prices are stale; &#8226; securities affected by significant events; and &#8226; securities that the Investment Advisor believes were priced incorrectly. Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates not susceptible to substantiation by auditing procedures. Accordingly, under current auditing standards, the notes to our financial statements will refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial statements. In making the good faith determination of the value of these securities, we start with the cost basis of the security, which includes the amortized original issue discount and PIK interest or dividends, if any. We prepare the valuations of our investments in portfolio companies using the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts. We also consult updates that we receive from senior management members at portfolio companies, whether solicited for valuation purposes, or received in the ordinary course of our portfolio monitoring or due diligence process. These updates include information such as industry trends, new product development or service offerings and other operational or strategic issues. For debt securities that are not publicly traded or for which there is no market, we begin with our investment rating of the security as described above. Using this investment rating, we seek to determine the value of the security as if we intended to sell the security in a current sale. The factors that may be taken into account in arriving at fair value include the following, as applicable: the portfolio company&#8217;s ability to service its interest and principal payment obligations, its estimated earnings &#160; and projected discounted cash flows, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the financial environment in which the portfolio company operates, comparisons to securities of similar publicly traded companies, statistical ratios compared to lending standards and to other similarly situated securities, and other relevant factors. As part of the valuation process, the audit committee reviews the preliminary evaluations prepared by the independent valuation firm engaged by the Board, as well as management&#8217;s valuation recommendations. Management and the independent valuation firm respond to the preliminary evaluation to reflect comments provided by the audit committee. The audit committee reviews the final valuation report and management&#8217;s valuation recommendations and makes a recommendation to the Board based on its analysis of the methodologies employed and the various weights that should be accorded to each portion of the valuation as well as factors that the independent valuation firm and management may not have considered in their evaluation process. The Board then evaluates the audit committee recommendations and undertakes a similar analysis to determine the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. Additionally, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to differ from the valuations assigned at any time. For a discussion of the risks inherent in determining the fair value of securities for which readily available market values do not exist, see &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; Determinations in Connection with Offerings In connection with certain future offerings of shares of our common stock, our Board, or an authorized committee thereof, will be required to make the determination that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price below the then current net asset value of shares of our common stock at the time at which the sale is made. Our Board, or an authorized committee thereof, will consider the following factors, among others, in making such a determination: &#8226; the net asset value of shares of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report that we filed with the SEC; &#8226; our management&#8217;s assessment of whether any material change in the net asset value of shares of our common stock has occurred (including through the realization of gains on the sale of our portfolio securities) during the period beginning on the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value of shares of our common stock and ending as of a time within 48 hours (excluding Sundays and holidays) of the sale of shares of our common stock; and &#8226; the magnitude of the difference between (i) a value that our Board, or an authorized committee thereof, has determined reflects the current (as of a time within 48 hours, excluding Sundays and holidays) net asset value of shares of our common stock, which is based upon the net asset value of shares of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report that we filed with the SEC, as adjusted to reflect our management&#8217;s assessment of any material change in the net asset value of shares of our common stock since the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value of shares of our common stock, and (ii) the offering price of the shares of our common stock in the proposed offering. Moreover, to the extent that there is even a remote possibility that we may (i) issue shares of our common stock at a price per share below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock at the time at which the sale is made or (ii) trigger the undertaking (which we provide in certain registration statements we file with the SEC) to suspend the offering of shares of our common stock if the net asset value per share of our common stock fluctuates by certain amounts in certain circumstances until the prospectus is amended, our Board will elect, in the case of clause (i) above, either to postpone the offering until such time that there is no longer the possibility of the occurrence of such event or to undertake to determine the net asset value per share of our common stock within two days prior to any such sale to ensure that such sale will not be below our then current net asset value per share and, in the case of clause (ii) above, to comply with such undertaking or to undertake to determine the net asset value per share of our common stock to ensure that such undertaking has not been triggered. These processes and procedures are part of our compliance policies and procedures. Records will be made contemporaneously with all determinations described in this section and these records will be maintained with other records that we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act. COMPETITION We compete for investments with other BDCs and investment funds (including private equity funds, private credit funds, mezzanine funds and other SBICs), as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other sources of funding. Additionally, competition for investment opportunities has emerged among alternative investment vehicles, such as collateralized loan obligations (&#8220;CLOs&#8221;) and other BDCs, some of which are sponsored by other alternative asset investors, as these entities have begun to focus on making investments in lower middle-market and traditional middle-market companies. As a result of these new entrants, competition for our investment opportunities may intensify. Many of these entities have greater financial and managerial resources than we do. We believe we will be able to compete with these entities primarily on the basis of our experience and reputation, our willingness to make smaller investments than other specialty finance companies, the contacts and relationships of our Investment Advisor, our responsive and efficient investment analysis and decision-making processes, and the investment terms we offer. We believe that certain of our competitors may make first lien and second lien loans with interest rates and returns that will be comparable to or lower than the rates and returns that we will target. Therefore, we will not seek to compete solely on the interest rates and returns that we offer to potential portfolio companies. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses.&#8221; ELECTION TO BE TAXED AS A RIC As a BDC, the Company has elected to be treated, and intends to comply with the requirements to continue to qualify annually, as a RIC under subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our &#8220;investment company taxable income,&#8221; which generally is our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the &#8220;Annual Distribution Requirement&#8221;). TAXATION AS A RIC For any taxable year in which we: &#8226; qualify as a RIC; and &#8226; satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, &#160; we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income we timely distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed to our stockholders. We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any ordinary and capital gain net income that we recognized in preceding years, but were not distributed during such years, and on which we paid no corporate-level U.S. federal income tax (the &#8220;Excise Tax Distribution Requirement&#8221;). In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: &#8226; continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; &#8226; derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, net income from certain &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnerships,&#8221; or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities (the &#8220;90% Income Test&#8221;); and &#8226; diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: &#8226; at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and &#8226; no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnerships&#8221; (the &#8220;Diversification Tests&#8221;). Qualified earnings may exclude such income as management fees received in connection with Fund III or other potential outside managed funds and certain other fees. In accordance with certain applicable Treasury regulations and other guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;), a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many stockholders elect to receive cash, each stockholder electing to receive cash must receive a pro rata amount of cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any stockholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than 20% of his or her entire distribution in cash. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these Treasury regulations or other applicable IRS guidance. We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest, deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock, or certain income with respect to equity investments in foreign corporations. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain &#8220;asset coverage&#8221; tests are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and\/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Distribution Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If we are prohibited from making distributions or are unable to obtain cash from other sources to make the distributions, we may fail to qualify as a RIC, which would result in us becoming subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. In addition, we will be partially dependent on Fund III for cash distributions to enable us to meet the RIC distribution requirements. Fund III may be limited by the SBIA, and SBA regulations governing SBICs, from making certain distributions to us that may be necessary to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC. We may have to request a waiver of the SBA&#8217;s restrictions for Fund III to make certain distributions to maintain our RIC tax treatment. We cannot assure you that the SBA will grant such waiver. If Fund III is unable to obtain a waiver, compliance with the SBA regulations may cause us to fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, which would result in us becoming subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. The remainder of this discussion assumes that we will qualify as a RIC and have satisfied the Annual Distribution Requirement. Any transactions in options, futures contracts, constructive sales, hedging, straddle, conversion or similar transactions, and forward contracts will be subject to special tax rules, the effect of which may be to accelerate income to us, defer losses, cause adjustments to the holding periods of our investments, convert long-term capital gains into short-term capital gains, convert short-term capital losses into long-term capital losses or have other tax consequences. These rules could affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to stockholders. We do not currently intend to engage in these types of transactions. A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its &#8220;investment company taxable income&#8221; (which is, generally, ordinary income plus net realized short-term capital gains in excess of net realized long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed gross taxable income (e.g., as the result of large amounts of equity-based compensation), we would experience a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, we may for U.S. federal income tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such required distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, you may receive a larger capital gain distribution than you would have received in the absence of such transactions. &#160; Investment income received from sources within foreign countries, or capital gains earned by investing in securities of foreign issuers, may be subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source. In this regard, withholding tax rates in countries with which the United States does not have a tax treaty are often as high as 35%. The U.S. has entered into tax treaties with many foreign countries that may entitle us to a reduced rate of tax or exemption from tax on this related income and gains. The effective rate of foreign tax cannot be determined at this time since the amount of our assets to be invested within various countries is not now known. We do not anticipate being eligible for the special election that allows a RIC to treat foreign income taxes paid by such RIC as paid by its stockholders. If we acquire stock in certain foreign corporations that receive at least 75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such as interest, dividends, rents, royalties or capital gain) or hold at least 50% of their total assets in investments producing such passive income (&#8220;passive foreign investment companies&#8221;), we could be subject to U.S. federal income tax and additional interest charges on &#8220;excess distributions&#8221; received from such companies or gain from the sale of stock in such companies, even if all income or gain actually received by us is timely distributed to our stockholders. We would not be able to pass through to our stockholders any credit or deduction for such a tax. Certain elections may, if available, ameliorate these adverse tax consequences, but any such election requires us to recognize taxable income or gain without the concurrent receipt of cash. We intend to limit and\/or manage our holdings in passive foreign investment companies to minimize our tax liability. In addition, under recently proposed regulations, income required to be included as a result of such an election would not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test unless we receive a distribution of such income from the passive foreign investment company in the same taxable year to which the inclusion relates. Foreign exchange gains and losses realized by us in connection with certain transactions involving non-dollar debt securities, certain foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency option contracts, foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currencies, or payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency are subject to Code provisions that generally treat such gains and losses as ordinary income and losses and may affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to our stockholders. Any such transactions that are not directly related to our investment in securities (possibly including speculative currency positions or currency derivatives not used for hedging purposes) could, under future Treasury regulations, produce income not among the types of &#8220;qualifying income&#8221; from which a RIC must derive at least 90% of its annual gross income. FAILURE TO QUALIFY AS A RIC If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions are applicable (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes or to dispose of certain assets). If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and the foregoing relief provisions are not applicable, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. Distributions would not be required, and any distributions would be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and, subject to certain limitations, may be eligible for the 20% maximum rate for noncorporate taxpayers provided certain holding period and other requirements were met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#8217;s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. To requalify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the nonqualifying year, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized within the subsequent five years, unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on such built-in gain at the time of our requalification as a RIC. REGULATION A BDC is regulated under the 1940 Act. A BDC must be organized in the U.S. for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. A BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies. We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company&#8217;s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business. As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be independent directors. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#8217;s office. As a BDC, we are generally required to meet an asset coverage ratio, defined under the 1940 Act as the ratio of our gross assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) to our outstanding senior securities, of at least 150%, if certain conditions are met, after each issuance of senior securities. On March 23, 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act (the &#8220;SBCA&#8221;) was signed into law, which included various changes to regulations under the federal securities laws that impact BDCs. The SBCA included changes to the 1940 Act to allow BDCs to decrease their asset coverage requirement from 200% to 150% (i.e. the amount of debt may not exceed 66.7% of the value of our total assets), if certain requirements are met. On November 1, 2018, the Board, including a &#8220;required majority&#8221; (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) approved the application of the modified asset coverage. As a result, our asset coverage requirements for senior securities were changed from 200% to 150%, effective November 1, 2019. We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. On October 23, 2018, the SEC issued an order granting an application for exemptive relief to an affiliate of our Investment Advisor that allows BDCs managed by the Investment Advisor, including Logan Ridge, to co-invest, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, in certain private placement transactions, with other funds managed by the Investment Advisor or its affiliates and any future funds that are advised by the Investment Advisor or its affiliated investment advisers. Under the terms of the exemptive order, in order for Logan Ridge to participate in a co-investment transaction, a &#8220;required majority&#8221; (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of Logan Ridge&#8217;s independent directors must conclude that (i) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to Logan Ridge and its stockholders and do not involve overreaching with respect of Logan Ridge or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (ii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the interests of Logan Ridge&#8217;s stockholders and is consistent with Logan Ridge&#8217;s investment objectives and strategies and certain criteria established by the Board. We believe this relief may not only enhance our ability to further our investment objectives and strategies, but may also increase favorable investment opportunities for us, in part by allowing us to participate in larger investments, together with our co-investment affiliates, than would be available to us in the absence of such relief. &#160; We are generally not permitted to issue and sell shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to raise additional capital and the way in which we do so. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.&#8221; We may, however, sell shares of our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our Board determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve our policy and practice of making such sales. In any such case, under such circumstances, the price at which shares of our common stock is to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board, closely approximates the market value of such common stock. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances. We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure.&#8221; QUALIFYING ASSETS Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as &#8220;qualifying assets&#8221;, unless, immediately after such acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDC&#8217;s gross assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our proposed business are the following: &#8226; Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering, the issuer of which is an eligible portfolio company; &#8226; Securities received in exchange for or distributed with respect to securities described in the bullet above or pursuant to the exercise of options, warrants or rights relating to such securities; and &#8226; Cash, cash items, government securities or high quality debt securities (within the meaning of the 1940 Act), maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. An eligible portfolio company is generally a domestic company that is not an investment company (other than a SBIC wholly owned by a BDC) and that: &#8226; does not have a class of securities with respect to which a broker may extend margin credit at the time the acquisition is made; &#8226; is controlled by the BDC and has an affiliate of the BDC on its board; &#8226; does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; &#8226; is a public company that lists its securities on a national securities exchange with a market capitalization of less than $250 million; or &#8226; meets such other criteria as may be established by the SEC. Control, as defined by the 1940 Act, is presumed to exist where a BDC beneficially owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company. In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the U.S. and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in eligible portfolio companies, or in other securities that are consistent with its purpose as a BDC. SIGNIFICANT MANAGERIAL ASSISTANCE TO PORTFOLIO COMPANIES BDCs generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the BDC controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC under the Code. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Investment Advisor will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. SENIOR SECURITIES We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150%, if certain requirements are met, immediately after each such issuance. On June 10, 2014, we received an exemptive order from the SEC granting relief from the asset coverage requirements for certain indebtedness issued by Fund II and Fund III as SBICs. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our gross assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure.&#8221; &#160; CODE OF ETHICS We and our Investment Advisor have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain transactions by our personnel. Our code of ethics generally does not permit investments by our employees in securities that may be purchased or held by us. Our code of ethics is also available on our website at www.loganridgefinance.com . COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES We and our Investment Advisor have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. David Held currently serves as our chief compliance officer. SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;) imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: &#8226; pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the 1934 Act, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; &#8226; pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; &#8226; pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the 1934 Act, our management is required to prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. As a non-accelerated filer, we are not currently required to obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm. &#8226; pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the 1934 Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to the Investment Advisor. The proxy voting policies and procedures of the Investment Advisor are set forth below. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by the Investment Advisor and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of the proxy voting policies and procedures described below, &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; refers to the Investment Advisor. Introduction An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of our clients. These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. Proxy Policies We will vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what we perceive to be the best interest of our clients&#8217; stockholders. We will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by our clients. Although we will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our clients&#8217; portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. Our proxy voting decisions will be made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our clients&#8217; investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we will require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our managing member any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. Proxy Voting Records You may obtain information about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Mount Logan Management LLC, LLC, 650 Madison Avenue, 23rd Floor, New York, New York 10022. PRIVACY PRINCIPLES We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain non-public personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third-party administrator). We restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to employees of our Investment Advisor and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders. &#160; SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANY REGULATIONS The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiaries Fund II and Fund III, historically used debenture leverage provided through the SBA to fund a portion of its investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $91.0 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. On June 10, 2021, Fund III repaid all of its remaining SBA-guaranteed debentures. As of December 31, 2020, Fund III had total assets of $186.0 million collateralizing its SBA-guaranteed debentures. On June 10, 2014, the Company received an exemptive order from the SEC exempting the Company, Fund II, and Fund III from certain provisions of the 1940 Act (including an exemptive order granting relief from the asset coverage requirements for certain indebtedness issued by Fund II and Fund III as SBICs) and from certain reporting requirements mandated by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to Fund II and Fund III. On March 1, 2019, Fund II repaid its outstanding SBA-guaranteed debentures and relinquished its SBIC license. On June 10, 2021, Fund III repaid its SBA-guaranteed debentures and relinquished its SBIC license. As of September 30, 2021, there were no SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. NASDAQ GLOBAL SELECT MARKET REQUIREMENTS We have adopted certain policies and procedures intended to comply with the NASDAQ Global Select Market&#8217;s corporate governance rules. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all future listing standards that are approved by the SEC and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.

BUSINESS &#160; Overview Unless otherwise indicated by the context, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Prestige&#8221; refer to Prestige Consumer Healthcare Inc. and our subsidiaries. Prior to August 17, 2018, the Company's name was Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc. Reference to a year (e.g., &#8220;2021&#8221;) refers to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. We formed as a Delaware corporation in 1996 and are engaged in the development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of well-recognized, brand name, over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) healthcare products to mass merchandisers, drug, food, dollar, convenience, club and e-commerce stores in North America (the United States and Canada) and in Australia and certain other international markets. We use the strength of our brands, our established retail distribution network, a low-cost operating model and our experienced management team to our competitive advantage. Our ultimate success is dependent on several factors, including our ability to: &#8226; Develop and execute effective sales, advertising and marketing programs to maintain or grow our share versus competitors over time; &#8226; Establish and maintain our manufacturing, third-party manufacturing and distribution relationships to fulfill customer demands; &#8226; Develop innovative new products; &#8226; Continue to grow our presence in the United States and international markets through acquisitions and organic growth, and; &#8226; Allocate capital effectively. We have grown our product portfolio both organically and through acquisitions. We develop our existing brands by investing in new product lines, brand extensions and strong advertising support. Acquisitions of consumer healthcare brands have also been an important part of our growth strategy. We pursue this growth following an acquisition through spending on advertising and marketing support, new sales and marketing strategies, improved packaging and formulations and innovative development of brand extensions. We conduct our operations in two reportable segments: North American OTC Healthcare and International OTC Healthcare. On July 2, 2018, we sold the Comet&#174;, Spic and Span&#174;, Chore Boy&#174;, Chlorinol&#174; and Cinch&#174; brands, as well as associated inventory, for approximately $65.9 million. These brands represented our Household Cleaning segment. Our business, business model, competitive strengths and growth strategy face various risks that are described in \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following summarizes the percent of our net revenues by segment: March 31, (In thousands) 2021 2020 2019 Segment: North American OTC Healthcare 90.0 % 89.2 % 88.4 % International OTC Healthcare 10.0 10.8 9.6 Household Cleaning &#8212; &#8212; 2.0 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % For additional information concerning our business segments, please refer to Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Major Brands and Market Position Our major brands, set forth in the table below, have strong levels of consumer awareness and retail distribution across all major channels. These brands accounted for approximately 80.3%, 80.5%, and 78.6% of our total revenues for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Major Brands Product Group Market Position (1) Market Segment (2) Brand Information North American OTC Healthcare: (3) &#160; &#160; BC&#174;\/Goody's Analgesics #1 Analgesic Powders Developed over 80 years ago, BC and Goody&#8217;s provide fast pain relief at the speed of powder Boudreaux's Butt Paste Dermatologicals #4 Baby Ointments Products include various diaper rash ointments produced with high-quality ingredients Chloraseptic Cough &#38; Cold #1 Sore Throat Liquids and Lozenges Products include sprays and lozenges to relieve sore throats and mouth pain Clear Eyes Eye &#38; Ear Care #1 Redness Relief Effective eye care that helps relieve redness and provides soothing comfort Compound W Dermatologicals #1 Wart Removal Provides safe and effective at-home removal of common and plantar warts Debrox Eye &#38; Ear Care #1 Ear Wax Removal Provides a safe and gentle way to remove excess ear wax or water from ear canal DenTek Oral Care #3 PEG Oral Care Products include floss picks, interdental brushes, dental guards, dental repair and wax, floss threaders, dental picks and tongue cleaners Dramamine Gastrointestinal #1 Motion Sickness Relief Includes non-drowsy, kids', original and nausea-free formulas Fleet Gastrointestinal #1 Adult Enemas and Suppositories First sold in 1869, products include enemas and suppositories Gaviscon Gastrointestinal #1 Upset Stomach Remedies Creates a foam barrier to keep stomach acid from backing up into the esophagus Luden's Cough &#38; Cold #3 Cough Drops Cough drop brand that is over 130 years old and includes a variety of flavors Monistat Women's Health #1 Vaginal Anti-Fungal Provides fast relief for yeast infections and is available in several different doses Nix Dermatologicals #1 Lice and Parasite Treatments Effective and safe lice and super lice treatments Summer's Eve Women's Health #1 Feminine Hygiene Offers a variety of feminine hygiene products including washes, cloths, sprays and powders International OTC Healthcare: Fess Cough &#38; Cold #1 Nasal Saline Sprays and Washes Helps relieve nasal and sinus congestion due to allergy, hay fever, colds and flu Hydralyte Gastrointestinal #1 Oral Rehydration Relieves symptoms of dehydration and helps replace water and electrolytes lost due to vomiting, diarrhea, heavy sweating, vigorous exercise and occasional hangovers (1) We have prepared the information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with regard to the market position for our brands based in part on data generated by Information Resources, Inc. (&#8220;IRI&#8221;), for the 52-week period ended March 21, 2021. International information was derived from several sources. Fess and Hydralyte data is for the Australian market. (2) &#8220;Market segment&#8221; is defined by us and is either a standard IRI category or a segment within a standard IRI category and is based on our product offerings and the categories in which we compete. (3) Some brands in the North American OTC Healthcare segment are also sold in the International OTC Healthcare segment. Our products are sold through multiple channels, including mass merchandisers, drug, food, dollar, convenience, club and e-commerce stores, which reduces our exposure to any single distribution channel. Market Position During 2021, approximately 69.2% of our total revenues were from major brands with a number one market position, compared with approximately 69.4% and 65.8% of total revenues during 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2021, these brands included BC\/Goody's, Chloraseptic , Clear Eyes , Compound W , Debrox, Dramamine, Fess, Fleet, Gaviscon, Hydralyte, Monistat, Nix, and Summer's Eve . Competitive Strengths and Growth Strategy We believe that our product portfolio is positioned for long-term growth based on the following factors: Diversified Portfolio of Well-Recognized and Established Consumer Brands We own and market a diverse portfolio of well-recognized consumer brands, some of which were established over 100 years ago. Our diverse portfolio of products provides us with multiple sources of growth and minimizes our reliance on any one product or category. We provide significant marketing support to our portfolio, which is designed to enhance our sales growth and our long-term profitability across our major brands and other significant brands, sometimes referred to as core brands. Strong Competitor in Attractive Categories We compete in product categories that address recurring consumer needs. We believe we are well positioned in these categories due to the long history and consumer awareness of our brands, our strong market positions, and our low-cost operating model. The markets in which we sell our products, however, are highly competitive and include numerous national and global manufacturers, distributors, marketers and retailers. As a result, any one or more of our brands could suffer a decline in market position or sales. Proven Ability to Develop and Introduce New Products We focus our marketing and product development efforts on the identification of under-served consumer needs, the design of products that directly address those needs, and the ability to extend our highly recognizable brand names to other products. One of our strategies is to broaden the categories in which we participate and increase our share within those categories through ongoing product innovation. As an example of this philosophy, in 2021 we launched a number of new products, including Summer's Eve Active Chafe Gel and Sprays, Monistat Feminine Cleanser, and Compound W Gel Plus ConSeal Patches . In 2020, we launched Summer's Eve Active , Summer's Eve Blissful Escape Spray , Goody's Hangover, DenTek Cross Flosser, and BC Max. While there is always a risk that sales of existing products may be reduced by new product introductions, our goal is to grow the overall sales of our brands. Investments in Advertising and Marketing We invest in advertising and marketing to drive the growth of our core brands. Our marketing strategy is focused primarily on consumer oriented initiatives that target consumers via mass media, digital marketing, in-store programming and coupons. While the absolute level of marketing expenditures differs by brand and category, we have often increased the amount of investment in our brands after acquiring them. Increasing Distribution Across Multiple Channels Our broad distribution base attempts to ensure that our products are well positioned across all available channels and that we are able to participate in changing consumer retail trends. In an effort to ensure continued sales growth, we continue to focus on expanding our reliance on direct sales while reducing our reliance on brokers for our non-top 25 customers. Growing Our International Business International sales beyond the borders of North America represented 10.0%, 10.8% and 9.6% of total revenues in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We have designed and developed both products and packaging for specific international markets and expect that our international revenues as a proportion of our total revenues will continue to grow over the long-term. Although our 2021 international sales as a proportion of our total revenues decreased, it was primarily attributable to decreased sales in Australia, largely related to both fewer general consumer illnesses and activities such as athletics resulting from the various social distancing measures brought on by the coronavirus (\"COVID-19\"). A number of our brands have previously been sold internationally, and we seek to expand the number of brands sold through our existing international distribution network and continue to identify additional distribution partners for further expansion of our brands into other international markets. Efficient Operating Model To gain operating efficiencies, we oversee the production planning and quality control aspects of the manufacturing, warehousing and distribution of our products, while we primarily outsource the operating elements of these functions to well-established third-party providers. This approach allows us to benefit from their core competencies and maintain a highly variable cost structure with low overhead, limited working capital requirements, and minimal investment in capital expenditures. Management Team with Proven Ability to Acquire, Integrate and Grow Brands Our business has grown through acquisition and expansion of the many brands we have purchased as a result of the efforts of our experienced management team. Our management team has significant experience in consumer product marketing, sales, legal and regulatory compliance, product development and customer service. We rely on experienced personnel to bear the substantial responsibility of brand management and to effectuate our growth strategy. Marketing and Sales Our marketing strategy is based on the acquisition and the rejuvenation of established consumer brands that possess what we believe to be significant brand value and unrealized potential and to grow categories with existing brands where we have leading market positions. Our marketing objective is to increase sales and market share by developing innovative new products and line extensions and executing creative and cost-effective advertising and marketing programs. After we acquire a brand, we implement a brand-building strategy that uses the brand&#8217;s existing consumer awareness to maximize sales of current products and provides a vehicle to drive growth through product innovation. Brand priorities will vary from year-to-year. This brand-building process involves the evaluation of the existing brand name, the development and introduction of innovative new products, and the execution of marketing support programs. Recognizing that financial resources are limited, we allocate our resources to focus on our core brands with the most impactful, consumer-relevant initiatives that we believe have the greatest opportunities for growth and financial success. Customers Our senior management team and dedicated sales force strive to maintain long-standing relationships with our top 25 domestic customers. We also contract with third-party sales management enterprises that interface directly with many of our remaining customers and report directly to members of our sales management team. In an effort to ensure continued sales growth, we continue to focus on expanding our reliance on direct sales while reducing our reliance on brokers for our non-top 25 customers. We enjoy broad distribution across each of the major retail channels, including mass merchandisers, drug, food, dollar, convenience, club and e-commerce stores. The following table sets forth the percentage of gross sales for our domestic customers across our six major distribution channels during each of the past three years ended March 31: &#160; Percentage of Gross Sales (1) Channel of Distribution 2021 2020 2019 Mass 34.5 36.5 37.4 Drug 22.4 25.6 26.4 Food 15.0 15.4 15.5 Dollar 7.7 6.6 6.8 Convenience 3.2 3.9 4.0 Club 1.8 1.4 1.6 Other (2) 15.4 10.6 8.3 (1) Includes estimates for some of our wholesale customers that service more than one distribution channel. (2) Includes e-commerce retailers such as Amazon. Due to the diversity of our product lines, we believe that each of these channels is important to our business, and we continue to seek opportunities for growth in each channel. We believe that our emphasis on strong customer relationships, speed and flexibility and leading sales technology capabilities, combined with consistent marketing support programs and ongoing product innovation, will continue to maximize our competitiveness in the increasingly complex retail environment. During 2021, 2020, and 2019, Walmart accounted for approximately 21.6%, 23.1%, and 23.7%, respectively, of our gross revenues. We expect that for future periods, our top ten customers, including Walmart, will in the aggregate continue to account for a large portion of our sales. Outsourcing and Manufacturing In order to maximize our competitiveness and efficiently allocate our resources, third-party manufacturers fulfill most of our manufacturing needs. We have found that contract manufacturing often maximizes our flexibility and responsiveness to industry and consumer trends while minimizing the need for capital expenditures. We select contract manufacturers based on their core competencies and our perception of the best overall value, including factors such as (i) depth of services, (ii) professionalism and integrity of the management team, (iii) manufacturing agility and capacity, (iv) regulatory compliance, and (v) competitive pricing. We require each of our suppliers, most of whom are based in the United States and Canada, to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which sets forth the basic and minimal expectations that all suppliers must meet in order to do business with us. We also conduct thorough reviews of each potential manufacturer&#8217;s facilities, quality standards, capacity and financial stability. We generally purchase only finished products from our manufacturers. Our primary contract manufacturers provide comprehensive services from product development through the manufacturing of finished goods. This management approach results in minimal capital expenditures and maximizes our cash flow, which allows us to reinvest to support our marketing initiatives, fund brand acquisitions or repay outstanding indebtedness. At March 31, 2021, we had relationships with 118 third-party manufacturers. Of those, we had long-term contracts with 19 manufacturers that produced items that accounted for approximately 70.5% of our gross sales for 2021, compared to 14 manufacturers with long-term contracts that accounted for approximately 62.3% of our gross sales in 2020. The fact that we do not have long-term contracts with certain manufacturers means that they could cease manufacturing our products at any time and for any reason or initiate arbitrary and costly price increases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Although we are in the process of negotiating long-term contracts with certain key manufacturers, we may not be able to reach a timely agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our long-term supply and manufacturing agreements explicitly outline the manufacturers&#8217; obligations and product specifications with respect to the brand or brands being produced, including allocation of product liability risk. However, the purchase price of products is subject to change pursuant to the terms of these agreements due to fluctuations in input costs such as raw material, packaging components and labor costs. Some of our other products are manufactured on a purchase order basis, which is generally based on batch sizes and results in no long-term obligations or commitments. To the extent we rely on purchase orders, rather than supply and manufacturing agreements, to govern our commercial relationships with suppliers, we typically rely on implied warranties with respect to the products manufactured, and we do not have specifically negotiated allocation of risk with these third-party manufacturers. In addition to relying on contract manufacturers, we operate a manufacturing facility in Lynchburg, Virginia, which manufactures products accounting for approximately 16% of our gross sales. We believe that most of the raw materials and packaging components used to produce our products at our manufacturing facility in Virginia and at our third-party manufacturing facilities are readily available through multiple sources. Warehousing and Distribution We manage product distribution in the continental United States through one facility, which is owned and operated by GEODIS Logistics LLC (\"GEODIS\"), a third-party provider. We entered into an agreement with GEODIS in May 2019 and transitioned to this facility from our previous provider during fiscal 2020. GEODIS provides warehouse services including storage, handling and shipping, as well as transportation services, with respect to our full line of products, including (i) complete management services, (ii) carrier claims administration, (iii) proof of delivery, (iv) procurement, (v) report generation, and (vi) freight payment services. Competition The business of selling brand name consumer products in the OTC Healthcare market is highly competitive. This market includes numerous national and global manufacturers, distributors, marketers and retailers that actively compete for consumers&#8217; business both in the United States and abroad. In addition, like most companies that market products in this category, we are experiencing continued competition from &#8220;private label&#8221; products introduced by major retail chains. While we believe that our branded products provide superior quality and benefits, we are unable to predict the extent to which consumers will purchase &#8220;private label&#8221; products as an alternative to branded products, although we expect that this may increase during an economic downturn. Our principal competitors include Johnson &#38; Johnson, The Procter &#38; Gamble Company, Reckitt Benckiser, Mondelez International, GlaxoSmithKline, Sunstar America, Inc., Combe, Bayer, Bausch Health Companies Inc., and Sanofi. We compete on the basis of numerous factors, including brand recognition, product quality, performance, value to customers, price, and product availability at the retail and e-commerce level. Advertising, marketing, merchandising and packaging, the timing of new product introductions, and line extensions also have a significant impact on customers&#8217; buying decisions and, as a result, on our sales. The structure and quality of our sales force, as well as sell-through of our products, affect in-store and online positioning, wall display space and inventory levels for retail sale. Our markets are also highly sensitive to the introduction of new products, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. Many of the competitors noted above are larger and have substantially greater research and development and financial resources than we do, and may therefore have the ability to spend more aggressively and consistently on research and development, advertising and marketing, and to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. See &#8220;Competitive Strengths&#8221; above for additional information regarding our competitive strengths and Part I, Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; below for additional information regarding competition in our industry. &#160; Regulation Product Regulation The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale and storage of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various U.S. federal agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\"), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (&#8220;CPSC&#8221;), and the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;), and various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured, marketed, distributed and sold. Our Regulatory team is guided by a senior member of management and staffed by individuals with appropriate quality, legal and regulatory experience. Our Regulatory, Quality and Operations teams work closely with our third-party manufacturers and our own manufacturing operation on quality-related matters, while we monitor our third-party manufacturers' compliance with FDA and foreign regulations and perform periodic audits to ensure compliance. This continual evaluation process is designed to ensure that our manufacturing processes and products are of high quality and in compliance with known regulatory and quality requirements. If the FDA or a foreign governmental authority chooses to audit a particular third-party manufacturing facility, we require the third-party manufacturer to notify us immediately and update us on the progress of the audit as it proceeds. If we or our manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could become subject to significant claims or penalties or be required to discontinue the sale of the non-compliant products. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant additional compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales. Most of our U.S. OTC drug products are regulated pursuant to the FDA&#8217;s monograph system. The monographs set out the active ingredients and labeling indications that are permitted for certain broad categories of U.S. OTC drug products. When the FDA has finalized a particular monograph, it has concluded that a properly labeled product formulation is generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. A tentative final monograph indicates that the FDA has not made a final determination about products in a category to establish safety and efficacy for a product and its uses. However, unless there is a serious safety or efficacy issue, the FDA typically will exercise enforcement discretion and permit companies to sell products conforming to a tentative final monograph until the final monograph is published. Products that comply with either final or tentative final monograph standards do not require pre-market approval from the FDA. Certain of our U.S. OTC drug products are New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) or Abbreviated New Drug Application (&#8220;ANDA&#8221;) products and are manufactured and labeled in accordance with an FDA-approved submission. These products are subject to reporting requirements as set forth in FDA regulations. Moving forward, OTC drug products will fall under the requirements of The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") signed into law on March 27, 2020, which includes the Over-the-Counter Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act. These new requirements are expected to be delineated by the FDA in 2023\/2024. Certain of our U.S. OTC Healthcare products are medical devices regulated by the FDA through a system that may involve pre-market clearance. During the review process, the FDA makes an affirmative determination as to the sufficiency of the label directions, cautions and warnings for the medical devices in question. Certain of our products are considered cosmetics regulated by the FDA through the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDC Act\") and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. The FDA does not require pre-market clearance for cosmetics but seeks to insure the products are not adulterated or misbranded. In accordance with the FDC Act and FDA regulations, we and our third-party manufacturers of U.S. products must also comply with the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;GMPs&#8221;). The FDA inspects our facilities and those of our third-party manufacturers periodically to determine that both we and our third-party manufacturers are complying with GMPs. Our dietary supplement products are governed by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (\"DSHEA\"), which defines and regulates dietary supplements. Under DSHEA, supplements are also effectively regulated by the FDA for GMPs. A number of our products are regulated by the CPSC under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (&#8220;FHSA&#8221;), the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (the &#8220;PPPA&#8221;) and the Consumer Products Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (&#8220;CPSIA&#8221;). In addition, a small number of our products are subject to regulation under the PPPA and can only be legally marketed if they are dispensed in child-resistant packaging or labeled for use in households where there are no children. The CPSIA requires us to make available to our customers certificates stating that we are in compliance with any applicable regulation administered by the CPSC. Nix Lice Control Spray is considered a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (&#8220;FIFRA&#8221;). Generally speaking, any substance intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest is considered to be a pesticide under FIFRA. Pesticides under FIFRA are required to be registered with the EPA and contain certain disclosures on the product labels. In addition, the contract manufacturers from which we source these products must be registered with the EPA. Our EPA registered products are also subject to state regulations and the rules and regulations of the various jurisdictions where these products are sold. Our international business is also subject to product regulations by local regulatory authorities in the various regions where these businesses operate, including regulations regarding manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution, sale and storage. Sustainability and Environmental, Social and Governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) Regulations We believe that sustainable operations are both financially and operationally beneficial to our business, and critical to the health of the communities in which we operate. Our operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations relating to environmental concerns, including air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste management activities, and the safety of our employees. We endeavor to take actions necessary to comply with such regulations including periodic environmental and health and safety audits of our facilities. The audits, conducted by independent firms with expertise in environmental, health and safety compliance, include site visits as well as a review of documentary information, to determine compliance with such federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations. We seek to ensure responsible sourcing of our products and to improve our suppliers&#8217; environmental, labor, health and safety and ethical practices through our Supplier Code of Conduct. We seek to minimize our resource footprint at our locations with a focus on managing waste, water and energy consumption. Other Regulations We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in various foreign markets, including regulations pertaining to import\/export, antitrust and pharmacovigilance issues. To the extent we decide to commence or expand operations in additional countries, we may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the country&#8217;s ministry of health or comparable agency. We must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that may vary from country to country. Government regulations in both our domestic and international markets can delay or prevent the introduction, or require the reformulation or withdrawal, of some of our products. Our failure to comply with these regulations can also result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market, either temporarily or permanently. In addition, we are subject to FTC and state regulations, as well as foreign regulations, relating to our product claims and advertising. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions and the imposition of penalties. Impact of Regulations Compliance with these various regulations has an impact on capital expenditures, earnings and our competitive position. Additional or shifting governmental regulation has and in the future could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, expanded adverse event reporting or other new requirements. Those changes have and will continue to require capital investments in facilities and equipment to meet the requirements, as well as additional product development, material and production costs which may impact our earnings and ability to compete. Intellectual Property We own a number of trademark registrations and applications in the United States, Canada and other foreign countries. The following are some of the most significant registered trademarks we own in the United States and\/or Canada: BC , Beano , Boudreaux's Butt Paste, Chloraseptic, Clear Eyes, Compound W, Debrox, DenTek, Dramamine, Fleet, Gaviscon , Goody's, Little Remedies, Luden's, Monistat, Nix, and Summer's Eve. Our trademarks and tradenames are how we convey that the products we sell are &#8220;brand name&#8221; products. Our ownership of these trademarks and tradenames is very important to our business, as it allows us to compete based on the value and goodwill associated with these marks. Additionally, we own or license patents on innovative and proprietary technology. The patents evidence the unique nature of our products, provide us with exclusivity, and afford us protection from the encroachment of others. None of the patents that we own or license, however, is material to us on a consolidated basis. Enforcing our rights, or the rights of any of our licensors, represented by these trademarks, tradenames and patents is critical to our business and may require significant expense. If we are not able to effectively enforce our rights, others may be able to dilute our trademarks, tradenames and patents and diminish the value associated with our brands and technologies. We do not own all of the intellectual property rights applicable to our products. In those cases where our third-party manufacturers own patents that protect our products, we are dependent on them as a source of supply for our products. In addition, we rely on our suppliers for their enforcement of their intellectual property rights against infringing products. Seasonality The first quarter of our fiscal year generally is the least profitable quarter due to the increased advertising and marketing spending to support those brands with a summer selling season, such as Clear Eyes products and Compound W, and generally the lowest level of sales attributable to multiple factors. The effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns in the third quarter influences sales of products such as Chloraseptic, Little Remedies, and Luden's, during the fourth quarter cough and cold winter months. Additionally, the fourth quarter typically has the lowest level of advertising and marketing spending as a percent of revenue. Human Capital Management Our Culture &#38; Diversity Our mission is to deliver high-quality consumer healthcare products that improve and enrich the lives of our consumers. Our Company culture is founded on the principles of Leadership, Trust, Change and Execution. Of those principles, Trust is among the most important. Trust in the safety and performance of our products, the integrity of our manufacturing and marketing processes, the character of our people, and the benefit to our consumers and society. We take pride in the wide range of backgrounds, races, nationalities, personalities, ideas, and talents that make up our organization. We continually review our Company employee demographics to help us adhere to our principles of diversity, equity and inclusion. We also reward employees who take ownership and embody our principle of Leadership with projects that positively impact our business, community and stakeholders. We strive to create and sustain a diverse and inclusive environment where all employees are inspired to achieve their full potential. We also believe in working productively with one another and with our stakeholders to ensure long-term success. Some of the ways we encourage this is by: &#8226; Recruiting : With employees across the U.S. and the world, we understand the importance of hiring and advancement practices that ensure diversity and equality at all levels of the organization as well as talent development. &#8226; Monitoring : We have a strict Code of Conduct and Ethics that fosters a work environment that is free from intimidation, harassment and violence. Our team employs a process to investigate and resolve any potential conduct or ethics concern that may violate our mission of diversity and inclusion. We use a third-party reporting avenue for employees to exercise any such concern safely and without threat of retaliation. Our Employees As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately 505 global employees. Approximately 88% of our workforce operates in the United States, 10% in Australia and Asia and 2% in Europe. 60% of our employees are salaried and 40% are paid hourly wages, mostly in production. We employ only a few part time employees. Our workforce of 505 employees is 53% female and 47% male. None of our employees are a party to a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes that our relations with employees are good. Strategic Development and Empowerment We encourage all employees to achieve their full potential by participating in our mentorship opportunities, career development programs and Company-provided learning tools. We provide meaningful responsibility and development opportunities to our employees worldwide. We employ a performance management process under which all employees receive reviews that not only assess performance, but identify specific developmental opportunities and learning goals for the individual. By empowering our employees to develop and enhance their skills through enterprise-wide tools, videos and coursework that focus on continuous learning and professional and personal development designed to strengthen and broaden skill sets, we help all of our employees reach their full potential, which in turn helps our organization succeed. Health and Safety We are committed to providing a safe work environment for our employees and require employees to share this concern by abiding to rigorous safety measures. To enable this and assure that the message of health, safety and well-being are part of our work culture, we conduct regular training programs at our production facility. We seek to comply with all federal, state and\/or local occupational safety and health standards and report our safety records in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\"). In 2020, we implemented protocols in response to the COVID-19 pandemic across all locations, in an effort to ensure both the safety of our employees and compliance with federal and local requirements and guidelines. Early in the pandemic, our office-based employees successfully transitioned to a remote workforce that we expect will continue until we have determined that it is in our employees&#8217; and the Company&#8217;s best interests to return to the office. During the pandemic, our dedicated production employees at our manufacturing facility in Lynchburg, VA have continued to operate three shifts a day with enhanced safety and health measures in place to protect their well-being. These measures have allowed employees the flexibility to attend to other unique personal and family needs brought on by the pandemic. Our Community We are a responsible corporate citizen and we resolve to live by our principles as we continue to grow our global business. We seek out opportunities to be active members of our communities to enhance the lives of our neighbors and consumers. We encourage employees to become actively involved in their respective communities, and we enable office locations the freedom to develop programs that are appropriate to their community needs. For example, our corporate headquarters office location has an annual &#8220;Day of Giving&#8221; where employees spend a day every December giving back to the nearby communities, while other office locations support their communities through various volunteerism events. Further information surrounding our Company&#8217;s human capital development and sustainability efforts are available on our Company&#8217;s website at https:\/\/www.prestigebrands.com\/about-us\/corporate-responsibility. Coronavirus Outbreak The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the United States and global economies, including causing significant volatility in the global economy and resulting in materially reduced economic activity since early 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding government responses have also led to increased unemployment, which led to a reduction in consumer spending. Economic conditions are, and we expect that they will continue to be, highly volatile and uncertain and could continue to reduce demand for our products and put downward pressure on prices. We did see an increase in sales at the end of March 2020 related to shelter-at-home restrictions as we believe consumers stocked up as a result of COVID-19, followed by a temporary but significant decline in consumption in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Since then, we have seen more stable consumer consumption and customer orders. Sales have varied throughout the year with some categories positively impacted (for instance, Women&#8217;s Health, Oral Care and Dermatological) and some categories negatively impacted (for instance, Cough &#38; Cold and Gastrointestinal). The positively impacted categories benefited from the consumer shift to over-the-counter healthcare products as consumers increased their focus on hygiene and self-care at home related to COVID-19. The declining categories were impacted by reduced incidence levels and usage rates due to shelter-at-home restrictions and limited travel related to COVID-19. Early in our first quarter of fiscal 2021, we received reports of an increase in absenteeism at our distribution center and with some of our suppliers; however, we have not experienced a material disruption to our overall supply chain to date. We have continued to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers, including the frequency of visits by consumers to retailers and a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material negative impact on our operations, overall demand for most of our products or resulting aggregate sales and earnings, and, as such, it has also not negatively impacted our liquidity position. We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs. These circumstances could change in this dynamic, unprecedented environment. If the outbreak continues to spread, it may materially affect our operations and those of third parties on which we rely, including causing disruptions in the supply and distribution of our products. We may need to limit operations and may experience material limitations in employee resources. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results and liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the effectiveness and availability of vaccines, the severity and impact of new COVID-19 strains, and the government and public health actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts of COVID-19 on our business or the global economy. However, these effects could have a material, adverse impact on our liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations and those of the third parties on which we rely.

","29":" Item 1. Business &#160; Overview &#160; We are a clinical stage biotherapeutics company focusing on advancing technologies to enable the administration of biologics orally, to provide patients, physicians, and healthcare systems with a convenient alternative to painful injections. We are advancing a portfolio of oral biologic therapeutics using our proprietary delivery technology. We have developed and clinically tested a drug-agnostic oral delivery platform, the RaniPill capsule, which can deliver any drug, including large molecules such as peptides, proteins, and antibodies. The current RaniPill capsule can deliver up to a 3 mg dose of drug with high bioavailability. We are also developing a high-capacity version known as the RaniPill HC, which is in preclinical stage and which is intended to enable delivery of drug payloads up to 20 mg with high bioavailability. Our current RaniPill capsule is optimized to orally deliver a variety of biologic therapeutics, and we are advancing development of the RaniPill HC to address biologics with higher dosing requirements. Together, we believe that the current RaniPill capsule and RaniPill HC could enable us to deliver most biologics currently on the market via a convenient, oral daily dose. We believe that our drug-agnostic and high bioavailability oral delivery technology positions us to be the leader in oral biologics. In March 2022, we initiated a phase 1 clinical trial with RT-102, a RaniPill capsule containing our proprietary formulation of parathyroid hormone (&#8220;PTH&#8221;), in Australia. The study will compare pharmacokinetics of PTH administered via RaniPill capsule to PTH administered via subcutaneous injection. We previously completed a phase 1 clinical study with RT-101, a RaniPill capsule containing our proprietary formulation of octreotide, in Australia. The phase 1 study successfully achieved both its primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating the safety and tolerability of RT-101 and achieving oral bioavailability of octreotide greater than 70%. No serious adverse events were reported . Market segment and technology More than half of the adult population of the U.S. has one or more chronic diseases. The affected population is expected to continue to grow as the population ages. Chronic conditions, including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic disorders, are increasingly being treated with biologics. In 2021, six of the ten highest revenue-producing drugs in the world were biologics. Current treatments using biologics are primarily via injection. Biologics, the fastest growing segment of the drug industry, refers to a broad class of drugs that are derived from living sources. Biologics are distinguished from small molecules, like aspirin, which derive from chemistry. Biologics include, for example, recombinant therapeutic proteins, peptides, and monoclonal antibodies, as well as cell and gene therapies. In 2019, worldwide sales of biologics were estimated to have reached approximately $269.0 billion and are projected to reach $465.0 billion by 2023. Biologics must generally be administered through intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection. Patient aversion to injections has promoted a significant interest in the development of solutions to enable the oral delivery of biologics. However, a significant hurdle is the ability to achieve sufficient bioavailability with oral biologics to produce an intended therapeutic effect. Bioavailability refers to the proportion of a delivered dose that reaches the bloodstream in active form. Attempts at oral delivery of biotherapeutics have remained largely unsuccessful due to the rapid degradation and digestion of biologics in the gastrointestinal (&#8220;GI&#8221;) environment before they can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Our solution is our novel, proprietary and patented platform technology referred to as the RaniPill capsule, an orally ingestible pill designed to automatically deploy in the small intestine to administer a precise therapeutic dose of a biologic into the intestinal wall. Our several preclinical studies and clinical trials have demonstrated bioavailability of dosing via the RaniPill capsule that is generally comparable to dosing subcutaneously, with high dosing accuracy: this level of bioavailability is significantly higher than any that has been demonstrated with respect to others&#8217; attempts at oral delivery of biologics. We are pursuing a number of clinical and preclinical pipeline programs utilizing our current RaniPill capsule. In addition, our newly designed high-capacity oral biologic delivery device, the RaniPill HC, has the potential to deliver 500%-plus higher payloads than our current RaniPill capsule. We believe this is a significant breakthrough in drug delivery with the potential to provide expansive opportunities for the company, such that we could potentially pursue a daily dosing option for over 50 additional biologics, for internal development or through partnership, including such biologics as pembrolizumab, etanercept, trastuzumab and &#160; &#160; secukinumab. We believe that oral biologics utilizing our RaniPill technology have the potential to disrupt the large and growing biologics market. Organizational Transactions &#160; Rani Holdings was formed as a Delaware corporation in April 2021 for the purpose of facilitating an initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) of its Class A common stock, to facilitate certain organizational transactions, and to operate the business of Rani LLC and its consolidated subsidiary RMS. In connection with the IPO, we established a holding company structure with Rani Holdings as a holding company and its principal asset is the Class A common units (&#8220;Class A Units&#8221;) of Rani LLC that it owns. As the sole managing member of Rani LLC, Rani Holdings operates and controls all of Rani LLC&#8217;s operations, and through Rani LLC and its subsidiary, conducts all of Rani LLC&#8217;s business. In connection with the IPO, we were party to the following organizational transactions (the &#8220;Organizational Transactions&#8221;): &#8226; Amended and restated Rani LLC&#8217;s operating agreement (the &#8220;Rani LLC Agreement&#8221;) to appoint Rani Holdings as the sole managing member of Rani LLC and effectuated an exchange of all outstanding interests in Rani LLC into Class A Units and an equal number of voting noneconomic Class B units. &#8226; Amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to provide for the issuance of (i) Class A common stock, each share of which entitles its holders to one vote per share, (ii) Class B common stock, each share of which entitles its holders to 10 votes per share on all matters presented to the Company's stockholders, (iii) Class C common stock, which has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law and (iv) preferred stock. &#8226; Certain holders of Class A Units tendered their Class A Units for shares of our Class A common stock. Certain holders of Class A Units continued to hold such Class A Units (&#8220;Continuing LLC Owners&#8221;) and received shares of our Class B common stock. &#8226; Continuing LLC Owners are entitled to exchange, subject to the terms of the Rani LLC Agreement, the Class A Units they hold in Rani LLC, together with the shares they hold of our Class B common stock (together referred to as a &#34;Paired Interest&#34;), in return for shares of the Company&#8217;s Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis provided that, at our election, we may effect a direct exchange of such Class A common stock or make a cash payment equal to a volume weighted average market price of one share of Class A common stock for each Paired Interest redeemed. Any shares of Class B common stock will be cancelled on a one-for-one basis if we, at the election of the Continuing LLC Owners, redeem or exchange such Paired Interest pursuant to the terms of the Rani LLC Agreement. &#8226; Entered into a registration rights agreement and tax receivable agreement (&#8220;Tax Receivable Agreement&#8221; or &#8220;TRA&#8221;) with certain of the Continuing LLC Owners. Our Strategy Our strategic vision is to disrupt and expand the approximately $269.0 billion market currently served by injectable only therapeutic biologics. We plan to do this by developing and advancing oral biologics therapies. We are committed to delivering oral biologic solutions for patients living with burdensome chronic diseases. We believe that the RaniPill capsule will improve the lives of millions of patients with chronic diseases who currently depend on biologics available only as injections. Our strategy includes the following aspects. &#8226; Pursue validated and commercially established market opportunities . We intend to pursue high-value markets with biologics that are already approved where we can develop our own differentiated products. We believe that these products will take market share from available therapies, while also expanding existing markets by reaching new patient populations that otherwise are not being treated by injectable biologics. &#8226; Establish the RaniPill capsule as a platform technology with regulatory authorities . We plan to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of the RaniPill capsule through clinical trials independent of any biologic. Data from these studies will be used to support subsequent regulatory applications for our product candidates. &#8226; Expand in-house manufacturing of the RaniPill capsule . We have vertically integrated our manufacturing, and plan to continue to scale and optimize our manufacturing processes by expanding our use of automation. &#160; &#160; &#8226; Invest in RaniPill capsule capabilities . We intend to become a leader in oral biologics by continuing to invest in our technology, such as by expanding payload capacity and developing novel biologic formulations to maximize the number of therapeutic targets and addressable markets. &#8226; Expand our reach by selectively entering into strategic partnerships . We are opportunistically exploring strategic partnerships to enable us to expand our commercial reach and enable oral administration of a broader array of biologics. &#8226; Continue to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio . Our patent portfolio has helped establish us as a leading oral biologics company. We plan to continue to innovate and expand our intellectual property by developing novel formulations and new applications of the RaniPill capsule. Rani LLC was founded by Mir Imran, our Chairman of the Board, who continues to contribute to our strategic planning and product development. Mir Imran has a background in medicine and engineering, is a prolific inventor, and a serial entrepreneur, having founded more than 20 life sciences companies. Our Platform Technology Each of our product candidates is a RaniPill capsule containing a biologic. We may use the term RaniPill platform herein to refer to the physical structure and\/or mechanisms of the RaniPill capsule absent a biologic. Our clinically tested RaniPill delivery platform described below is intended to be capable of delivering up to a 3 mg dose of any drug. We are also developing a high-capacity version known as the RaniPill HC, which is in preclinical stage and which is intended to enable delivery of drug payloads up to 20 mg. The RaniPill capsule The RaniPill capsule is a versatile, drug-agnostic, orally ingestible pill approximately the size of a fish oil or calcium pill or a &#8216;000&#8217;-sized capsule. &#160; &#160;&#160; The capsule includes a proprietary coating designed to withstand stomach acid but dissolve in the jejunum portion of the small intestine. Dissolution of the coating leads to a series of steps that result in a biologic being delivered into the highly vascularized wall of the small intestine so that the biologic can be absorbed into the vasculature and enter the bloodstream. &#160; The following illustrations depict the clinically tested RaniPill capsule traversing through and deploying within a lumen of the intestine illustrated in cross section. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;Panel A &#160; Panel B &#160; Panel C &#160; Panel D Panel A : As the RaniPill capsule exits the stomach and enters the small intestine, the higher pH environment of around 6.5 in the jejunum begins to dissolve the coating. Panel B : Dissolution of the coating exposes a balloon in the RaniPill capsule to intestinal fluid which results in the balloon self-inflating. Panel C : Inflation of the balloon orients a microneedle contained within the balloon approximately perpendicular to the intestinal wall. The pressure in the balloon delivers the microneedle, which is smaller than a grain of rice, into the intestinal wall. The microneedle dissolves in the moist tissue environment, and the drug is absorbed into the vasculature and thereby into the bloodstream. Panel D : The balloon immediately deflates upon microneedle delivery and is excreted through normal digestive processes. Features and advantages of the RaniPill capsule The RaniPill capsule is a result of years of internal research activities to develop and optimize specialized components and systems that make up the RaniPill capsule. Several advanced features are included in the RaniPill capsule, providing what we believe to be significant and sustainable competitive advantages in the field of oral delivery of biologics. Some of the features and advantages of the RaniPill capsule are listed below. &#8226; High bioavailability and high dosing accuracy &#8211; Our studies conducted to date have demonstrated that the RaniPill capsule delivers biologics with bioavailability that is generally comparable to dosing subcutaneously, with high dosing accuracy. This level of bioavailability is similar to subcutaneous injection and is significantly higher than that of currently marketed chemistry-based oral biologics, the best attempts of which to our awareness have resulted in peptides being delivered with only low single-digit bioavailability. &#8226; Protective coating avoids deployment in the stomach &#8211; The proprietary protective coating formulation is pH-sensitive, enabling the RaniPill capsule to maintain its integrity through the acidic environment in the stomach for deployment in the small intestine. &#8226; Protection of the drug prior to delivery &#8211; The microneedle is protected from intestinal fluid until delivery, and then the rapid injection of the microneedle into the intestinal wall during delivery provides for little or no exposure of the microneedle to intestinal fluid. This technique serves to overcome the body&#8217;s natural mechanisms that break biologics down in the harsh GI environment and thus block biologics from reaching the blood stream from within the intestine. &#8226; Proprietary microneedle design preserves drug integrity and sterility &#8211; The proprietary dissolvable microneedle is made from injectable-grade, sterile materials. The microneedle is designed to accommodate in its hollow interior a biologic formed into a microtablet of up to 3 mg. Once exposed to body fluids, the microneedle begins to dissolve and expose the biologic for absorption into the vasculature. The sealed microneedle preserves the integrity and sterility of the biologic until the microneedle dissolves. &#8226; Delivery of the microneedle in both fed and fasted states &#8211; The RaniPill capsule is designed to deliver the microneedle even if the patient ingests the RaniPill capsule with or after a meal, which we expect will allow for more flexible dosing regimens and improved patient adherence to a given regimen. &#8226; Self-inflating balloon ensures reliable delivery &#8211; The proprietary self-inflating balloon is designed to provide optimal pressure to deliver the microneedle. In addition, the novel design of the balloon positions the microneedle &#160; &#160; approximately perpendicular to the intestinal wall for reliable drug delivery, with up to 80% drug delivery success observed in our clinical trial of RT-101. The self-inflating balloon has been designed to minimize GI discomfort. &#8226; Drug-agnostic design provides a standardized platform &#8211; The RaniPill capsule is designed to deliver any molecule irrespective of molecular mass. This allows a single platform design to be used with multiple drugs. &#8226; Optimized dosing regimen &#8211; Based on the confirmed patient preference for oral delivery alternatives, we expect better treatment adherence with oral dosing versus injections, thus enabling a more physician-selectable dosing regimen. For example, the RaniPill capsule may enable a regimen of small daily doses, versus larger less-frequent doses for injections prescribed to improve treatment adherence; small daily dosing may allow for therapeutic exposures to be maintained within a narrow range, whereas larger less frequent injection dosing can lead to large variations in therapeutic exposure, which can directly contribute to adverse events, loss of efficacy, and increased propensity for immunogenic response. Studies underscoring the advantages of the RaniPill capsule Platform study in humans confirming reliable deployment in fed and fasted states An initial clinical assessment of the RaniPill capsule (without a drug) was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the platform and to compare device performance in fed and fasted states in twenty healthy volunteers, divided into two groups of ten. In one group, the RaniPill capsule was administered under fasting conditions, while the other group was given the RaniPill capsule 45 minutes after consumption of a standardized meal. X-ray imaging was used to monitor transit of the device as well as its deployment. The evaluation involved the use of capsules that were not equipped with a drug or needle. The goals of this study were tolerability and effects of food on the RaniPill capsule&#8217;s functionality, as measured by the time required for the RaniPill capsule to reach and deploy in the small intestine. The total transit time for the RaniPill capsule was longer in the fed group than in the fasted group because the capsule remained in the stomach longer in the fed group. However, food did not impact the deployment time of the RaniPill capsule. This was confirmed via radiographic tracking which showed successful balloon inflation, indicating both that the protective coating dissolved as designed and the balloon inflated as designed, regardless of the presence of matter in the lumen of the intestinal tract. No volunteers reported difficulty in swallowing the capsule, nor did any study participant report experiencing pain or sensing an awareness upon balloon deployment. Patient and physician survey indicating strong preference for pills over injections even for infrequent dosing We commissioned an independent third-party survey to investigate United States patient and physician preference for oral medications versus injections. The results clearly indicated that both patients and prescribing physicians would prefer pills to injections over a broad base of patient populations and treatment regimens. The results also indicate that a majority of physicians would be likely to prescribe an oral regimen as a first line therapy. Across all patient groups, genders, ages, conditions treated, and severity of condition, there was a consistently strong preference for switching from injections to pills, even for infrequent injection regimens of up to six months. &#160; The 611 responding patients were aged 18 years or older and presently using an injectable biologic to treat a condition. Six patient groups each included 100-103 patients with current primary treatment being injections of Simponi, Entyvio, Stelara, Prolia, Evenity, or Cosentyx. The 201 responding physicians, mostly endocrinologists and rheumatologists, were presently prescribing injectable biologics to their patients. The physicians answered questions regarding the biologics listed with respect to the patient groups as well as five additional biologics (Natpara, Forteo, Tymlos, Norditropin, and Genotropin). The results of this extensive patient preference survey across a large and varied patient population are consistent with the results obtained from our prior patient preference survey showing, for example, that 88% of rheumatoid arthritis patients taking Humira injections once every two weeks would prefer a daily pill and 76% of patients taking Prolia once every six months would prefer a daily pill. In each patient group surveyed, at least 64% of respondents would prefer a daily pill to their current injectable treatment regimen. Repeat-dose studies &#160; &#160; &#160; We have conducted two seven-day repeat-dose studies in canines under GLP guidelines, with no safety issues or adverse events observed. These studies indicate the potential for safe, daily dosing with the RaniPill capsule. Our Pipeline The broad utility of the RaniPill capsule to enable the oral delivery of biologics reliably provides us with a range of attractive development opportunities. We have prioritized development based on specific scientific, developmental, regulatory, and commercial considerations to optimize our portfolio of targeted product candidates. Our internal development targets are focused on well-characterized molecules with attractive commercial characteristics. We believe selection of these targets will allow us to potentially accelerate product approval and market launch, while also broadening patient, provider, and payor acceptance of the RaniPill capsule. We have tested the RaniPill capsule with several biologics, in numerous preclinical studies. In March 2022, we initiated testing of RT-102 in a Phase 1 clinical trial in Australia. Previously, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of RT-101 in Australia. Below is a summary of our product candidate pipeline. We believe these drugs are compatible with our technology based on their dosage and dosing schedule. Most importantly, if clinical testing proves successful and our product candidates are approved by regulatory authorities, these products would give millions of patients a convenient, oral option to effectively manage their diseases. We may complement these programs with robust partnering activities to maximize the value inherent in the RaniPill capsule. &#160;RT-XXX refers to the RaniPill capsule containing a biologic in a proprietary Rani formulation. * Each of these indications will require separate regulatory approvals. **Changchun High &#38; New Technology Industries will have a limited opportunity to negotiate for rights within China. *** Timelines are subject to regulatory agency review delays. RT-101: Octreotide for the treatment of NETs and acromegaly Market overview and currently approved products Octreotide, developed by Novartis AG and sold under the brand name Sandostatin, is a truncated and modified form of the human somatostatin. Somatostatin is a peptide hormone involved in the regulation of the endocrine system. It acts as an inhibitory hormone and influences hGH release, insulin and glucagon secretion, regional blood flow, gastric acid secretion, intestinal mobility, and neuronal activity. Octreotide is a more potent mimetic with a significantly longer half-life than naturally occurring somatostatin. &#160; &#160; Octreotide is currently approved by the FDA and EMA for the symptomatic treatment of acromegaly, a disorder involving the secretion of excessive growth hormone, as well as carcinoid syndrome, a condition involving NETs of the GI tract. Current treatment using octreotide involves painful subcutaneous injections administered three to four times daily or an extended-release formulation via painful, deep intramuscular injections every four weeks. Despite the inconvenience of the current route of administration, the worldwide market for octreotide in 2020 was approximately $2.7 billion. A chemistry-based attempt to develop an oral version of octreotide for treatment of acromegaly (MYCAPSSA from Amryt Pharma) resulted in a product with less than 1% bioavailability, which, due to this low bioavailability, was approved only for maintenance therapy of acromegaly patients on a low (100 &#181;g) dose. The total patient population of NETs and acromegaly in the United States is estimated to be around 200,000. Approximately 12,000 new cases of NETs and 3,000 new cases of acromegaly are diagnosed annually in the United States. The worldwide market for injectable somatostatin analogs is approximately $6.0 billion annually across both indications. Our solution: RT-101 We are developing RT-101, the RaniPill capsule containing our novel formulation of octreotide, for oral treatment of NETs and acromegaly. We have worldwide commercial rights to RT-101. We believe that the oral delivery route provided by RT-101 has the potential to take market share from injectables and expand oral delivery of octreotide beyond the limited reach of MYCAPSSA. Preclinical studies RT-101 Pharmacokinetic study &#160; Pharmacokinetic (&#8220;PK&#8221;) profiles of octreotide delivered as RT-101 were obtained in conscious beagles, and compared to that of an equivalent IV dose of the commercially available product, Sandostatin&#174;. All animals receiving RT-101 tolerated the oral administration of the capsule. For the RT-101 group, the average maximum concentration (&#8220;Cmax&#8221;) was 9.9 &#177; 1.2 ng\/ml and average Tmax for the group was 22 &#177; 3 minutes after payload delivery. The average absolute bioavailability of octreotide delivered via RT-101 was 78%. RT-101 seven-day repeat dose GLP study Tolerability and reliability of RT-101 was assessed in a seven-day administration study in canines, under GLP guidelines. RT-101 was orally administered daily to test group animals, and control group animals received an enteric coated capsule containing nonpareil sugar. Blood samples were collected after each RT-101 dose was administered to confirm successful payload delivery by measuring plasma concentrations of the drug. Plasma samples analyzed from test group animals showed that 77% of the administered devices successfully delivered the drug, with seven of eight animals having at least five successful payload deliveries over the seven-day dosing period. RT-101 was well-tolerated by all animals in the study. There were no clinical adverse effects observed in either group throughout the study duration. The GI tract was critically evaluated in all animals and no significant macroscopic or microscopic abnormalities were observed in any animal. These results demonstrated that the RaniPill capsule can be consumed on a daily basis for seven days, deploy within the targeted region of the small intestine without causing any adverse clinical effects, and remnants can be excreted without complications. Clinical trials Endoscopic delivery of octreotide into the jejunum of healthy volunteers To obtain early proof-of-concept data, we evaluated PK of Sandostatin&#174; (a commercial formulation of octreotide) delivered via a direct injection into the jejunal wall to mimic the intended route of delivery by the RaniPill capsule. Results from this study, which involved five healthy volunteers, showed a highly similar PK profile of octreotide delivered by a direct injection into the intestinal wall to that obtained with RT-101 in its Phase 1 clinical trial. ( See below RT-101 Phase 1 study ). These data indicate that a change in formulation of octreotide from liquid to solid form did not significantly affect the PK of the drug. RT-101 Phase 1 study We conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial with RT-101 in 62 healthy subjects to evaluate safety and tolerability as primary endpoints and bioavailability as a secondary endpoint. Bioavailability of octreotide delivered via RT-101 was 65% relative to an intravenous control group. We believe this is the first demonstration of such high bioavailability of an oral biologic in humans. To date, the best published bioavailability for oral octreotide is approximately 1%. The results of the RT-101 Phase 1 clinical trial support &#160; &#160; the utility of the RaniPill capsule to deliver octreotide orally, and at levels of octreotide comparable to subcutaneous injection. In addition, the results indicate that the RaniPill capsule may be used for other biologics. A similar study conducted in awake canines shows that the data from the canine model were consistent with the PK data obtained in humans, indicating that the canine is an appropriate model for octreotide. Future clinical trials We are currently optimizing the formulation for RT-101, to potentially enable once daily dosing. Once optimized, we will test and verify the formulation in appropriate animal models. Once the formulation is validated in preclinical studies, we plan to initiate clinical trials for the development of RT-101. RT-102: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) for the treatment of osteoporosis Market overview and currently approved products Osteoporosis is a bone disease where bone mineral density and bone mass decreases, leading to a decrease in bone strength that can increase the risk of fractures. Osteoporosis affects women and men of all races and ethnic groups. Osteoporosis can occur at any age, although the risk for developing the disease increases with age. PTH is an effective bone-building treatment for osteoporosis. PTH is a hormone secreted by the parathyroid glands that regulates serum calcium concentration and promotes bone growth. PTH therapies are delivered by daily subcutaneous injections for up to 2 years. Approximately 10 million Americans suffer from osteoporosis; however, we estimate that only a small fraction of this population is being treated with a form of PTH. While there may be other reasons for this, we believe that patient aversion to daily injections may be a major factor. As a result, non-bone-building and less effective antiresorptive drugs are used as first line therapies because they are available in oral form. Teriparatide, a synthetic form of the natural human parathyroid hormone hPTH(1-34), is a PTH analog administered as a once-daily injection to treat osteoporosis, first developed by Eli Lilly and Company and sold under the brand name Forteo. Another PTH analog injectable is Tymlos by Radius Health, Inc., approved in 2017. A teriparatide biosimilar injectable by Pfenex, Inc. was approved in 2019. Annual sales revenue of PTH analogs and biosimilars globally in 2019 was approximately $2.0 billion. Our solution: RT-102 We are developing RT-102, the RaniPill capsule containing our novel formulation of PTH, for oral treatment of osteoporosis. We have worldwide commercial rights to RT-102. In addition to the existing market, we believe there is an opportunity to expand the market by advancing RT-102 as a first line therapy for osteoporosis. Preclinical studies Dose escalation study We conducted a preclinical study with RT-102 where PK of PTH was determined in awake beagles at varying dosage levels of teriparatide formulation. Reference PK curves were also generated using Forteo administered at the approved dose and route of delivery of 20 &#181;g subcutaneous liquid injection. Results of this study in terms of concentration-time profiles of hPTH(1-34) are provided in the following graph. RT-102 yielded steep increases in concentration of PTH followed by a rapid decline to baseline levels, similar to the subcutaneous controls. Such a profile is desirable to produce an osteoanabolic effect. The overall duration of drug exposures remained short with drug concentrations returning to baseline levels within three hours. RT-102 was well tolerated by all animals with no significant adverse events noted at any of the doses tested. Seven-day repeat dose GLP study with RT-102 Tolerability and reliability of RT-102 was assessed in a multi-day administration study in canines, under GLP guidelines. RT-102 was administered daily to eight test animals, and another four control animals received an enteric coated capsule containing nonpareil sugar followed by a seven-day washout period. Blood samples were collected after each RT-102 dose was administered to determine payload delivery by measuring plasma concentrations of the drug. The RaniPill capsule was well-tolerated by all animals in the study. Plasma samples analyzed from test group animals showed that 61% of the administered devices successfully delivered the &#160; &#160; drug. There were no clinical adverse effects observed in either group throughout the study duration. The GI tract was critically evaluated in all animals and no significant macroscopic abnormalities were observed in any animal. Clinical trials In March 2022, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of RT-102 in Australia. The single-center, open label, Phase 1 study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of parathyroid hormone administered via the RaniPill capsule in healthy adult women volunteers. RT-102 will be ingested orally, administering a single dose of parathyroid hormone. Doses given will range from 20 to 80 &#956;g. RT-105: Anti-TNF-alpha antibody for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis Market overview and currently approved products Anti-TNF-alpha antibodies such as adalimumab are used to treat a range of inflammatory disorders and are among the largest selling class of pharmaceutical drugs globally as measured by revenue. Adalimumab, sold by AbbVie Inc. under the brand name Humira, generated sales of approximately $20.7 billion in 2021. Adalimumab is approved by the FDA and EMA to treat a range of autoimmune conditions, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn&#8217;s disease. In the U.S. alone, there are an estimated 1.5 million patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 7 million with psoriasis, and 3 million with Crohn&#8217;s disease or ulcerative colitis. Currently, six Humira biosimilars have been approved by the FDA, but will not enter the U.S. market until 2023, per licensing agreements with the originator. Patients who use adalimumab administer the drug through a painful subcutaneous injection once every two weeks. Despite the painful injections required to administer it, adalimumab was the best-selling drug globally in 2020. Our solution: RT-105 We are developing RT-105, the RaniPill capsule containing our novel formulation of adalimumab, for oral treatment of a host of inflammatory conditions, beginning with treatment of psoriatic arthritis and later expanding to other indications for which TNF-alpha inhibitors are approved. We have worldwide commercial rights to RT-105. We believe that the development of an orally administered anti-TNF-alpha antibody represents a significant market opportunity. Our preclinical studies and clinical trials with adalimumab have demonstrated the successful delivery of a large antibody via the RaniPill platform. Moreover, our studies indicate that serum concentrations comparable to the approved subcutaneous dosing method can achieved for antibody therapies using the RaniPill platform, providing compelling evidence that the RaniPill capsule could be a viable alternative to painful subcutaneous antibody injection therapies. Preclinical studies We evaluated the performance of RT-105 containing an adalimumab biosimilar in awake canines and compared it to the performance of the adalimumab biosimilar given by way of subcutaneous and intravenous injection. The PK profile for RT-105 was comparable to the profile for subcutaneous administration, and mean bioavailability for RT-105 was 49%, compared to 46% with subcutaneous injection. Clinical trials Endoscopic administration of adalimumab into the jejunum of healthy human volunteers To assess whether the observations from preclinical studies regarding absorption of adalimumab through the intestinal wall translate to clinical trials, we conducted an endoscopic study in humans. The study involved 10 healthy volunteers and compared the PK of an approved formulation of adalimumab injected endoscopically into the jejunal intestinal wall, which mimics the RaniPill capsule route of administration, to that of an identical dose injected subcutaneously. Blood samples were obtained at prescribed intervals during a 14-day study period. PK profiles were similar with no notable differences observed in either area under curve (&#8220;AUC&#8221;) or Cmax. The mean AUC was 62.7 &#177; 11.4 &#181;g\/ml*day*kg\/mg for the subcutaneous group and 45.0 &#177; 29.0 &#181;g\/ml*day*kg\/mg for the intrajejunal group. No serious adverse events were noted in this study, and adverse events of headache and flu-like symptoms after intrajejunal administration resolved within 48 hours. The results are consistent with data obtained in preclinical studies, confirming intrajejunal delivery as a viable route of delivery for adalimumab. &#160; &#160; Phase 1 We plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of RT-105 in healthy volunteers in 2023. RT-109: Human growth hormone (hGH) for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency Market overview and currently approved products Juvenile growth disorders and adult growth hormone deficiency affect between 30,000 and 80,000 people in the U.S. Growth hormone is a peptide that is secreted by the pituitary gland and promotes cell growth, proliferation, and regeneration. This anabolic hormone also stimulates insulin-like growth factor 1 which has growth enhancing effects on a broad set of tissues. HGH is approved by the FDA for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency. A recombinant form of hGH is used to treat juvenile growth disorders and adult growth hormone deficiency. Treatment involves painful daily subcutaneous hGH injections often over multiple years. Genentech, Inc., now part of Roche Holding AG, pioneered the use of recombinant hGH, receiving FDA approval for its commercial sale in 1985. HGH is currently available from a number of sources and is sold by Eli Lilly and Company under the brand name Humatrope and by Genentech, Inc. under the brand name Nutropin. Worldwide sales of hGH were approximately $3.9 billion in 2020 and are projected to reach $9.2 billion by 2030. Our solution: RT-109 We are developing RT-109, the RaniPill capsule containing our novel formulation of hGH, for oral treatment of growth hormone deficiency. We have worldwide commercial rights to RT-109. We have entered into an Evaluation and First Right of Refusal Agreement with Changchun High &#38; New Technology Industries (&#8220;CCHN&#8221;), which includes limited rights to negotiate commercialization rights for RT-109 in China. Because patients typically need daily injections of hGH over several years, we believe that a once-daily oral version would transform treatment regimens for both pediatric and adult patients. Preclinical studies We are conducting preclinical PK studies with RT-109. Clinical trials We plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers in the second half of 2022. RT-110: PTH for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism Market overview and currently approved products Hypoparathyroidism is a rare condition of low levels of serum PTH resulting in low calcium levels in the blood. The prevalence of hypoparathyroidism in the United States is approximately 115,000 people. PTH is currently approved for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism by the FDA and EMA. PTH treatment requires lifelong daily injections but has suboptimal efficacy. Treatment of hypoparathyroidism is most effective with consistent and sustained plasma levels of PTH. Our solution: RT-110 We are developing RT-110, the RaniPill capsule containing our second novel formulation of PTH, for oral treatment of hypoparathyroidism. We have worldwide commercial rights to RT-110. We believe that there is an unmet need for a delivery method more convenient than injection, and we further believe that the RaniPill capsule will provide for a treatment regimen that can better maintain consistent and sustained plasma levels of PTH than the current treatment regimen of daily PTH injections. Preclinical studies We are creating a sustained release formulation of RT-110 which will provide for continuous exposures of the hormone required to normalize the calcium imbalance in hypoparathyroidism patients. We plan to conduct preclinical PK studies of RT-110 prior to initiating human clinical studies. &#160; &#160; Clinical trials We plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers in 2023. Collaboration Opportunities We envision complementing our core programs with robust partnering activities to maximize the value inherent in the RaniPill capsule. One market segment for which we believe that the RaniPill capsule can add significant value is the treatment of diabetes. The CDC estimates that approximately 10% of the U.S. population have diabetes. Of these, 90% to 95% suffer from Type 2 diabetes, which is characterized by progressive hyperinsulinemia (pre-diabetes or insulin resistance) followed by hyperglycemia as a result of the body&#8217;s inability to properly respond to insulin and, eventually, produce sufficient insulin. Diabetes has no known cure and can give rise to a host of serious and often life-threatening complications, including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, retinopathy, cognitive impairment, and stroke. This results in estimated economic costs totaling over $300.0 billion in the United States annually. Further, according to the CDC, about a third of Americans are pre-diabetic, a health condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal for long periods as a result of progressing insulin resistance. In addition to the potential of the RaniPill capsule to replace treatment by injections, we believe that an oral treatment option could be adopted earlier in the treatment of diabetes or adopted to treat pre-diabetic patients, which could result in improved outcomes in the pre-diabetic and diabetic patient populations. Due to the size, cost, and complexity of clinical trials required to address the diabetes market, our strategy is to partner with large pharmaceutical companies to create oral versions of injected diabetes drugs, such as GLP-1 mimetics and basal insulin. RT-104: GLP-1 mimetic for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes Market overview and currently approved products GLP-1 mimetics are used to treat Type 2 diabetes by increasing insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon secretion. Several large pharmaceutical companies market GLP-1 mimetics, and the global combined sales of these were estimated to be $12.7 billion in 2020. Our solution: RT-104 We are developing RT-104, the RaniPill capsule containing our novel formulation of a GLP-1 mimetic, for oral treatment of Type 2 diabetes. Based on a survey we commissioned, we found that 89% of endocrinologists prescribing GLP-1 mimetics were likely to switch their prescription to a once-daily pill if available, and we believe that RT-104 would be more appealing to patients than the presently available injectable form. We have worldwide commercial rights to RT-104. Clinical trials Clinical study with Byetta We conducted a proof-of-concept study in humans with Byetta, a branded form of the GLP-1 mimetic exenatide. Five healthy subjects were dosed with Byetta via an intrajejunal injection to mimic the RT-104 route of administration and then, after a washout period, the subjects were dosed with a subcutaneous injection of Byetta. PK profiles of exenatide were similar between subcutaneous injection and intrajejunal injection. The AUC for intrajejunal injection was 27 &#177; 3 ng\/ml*min and for subcutaneous injection was 23 &#177; 2 ng\/ml*min. These data provide evidence that delivery of exenatide via the intrajejunal route of the RaniPill capsule will yield bioavailability similar to subcutaneous injections. While we continue to optimize our formulation to increase drug half-life, we plan to pursue partnership opportunities with large pharmaceutical companies to further develop and commercialize RT-104. &#160; &#160; RT-106: Basal insulin for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes Market overview and currently approved products In addition to oral anti-diabetic drugs and lifestyle changes, patients with advanced Type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar by administering painful daily injections including one or both types of: (1) a single injection of a longer-acting insulin called basal insulin, which provides a steady baseline of insulin to offset insulin resistance and reduce hyperinsulinemia; and (2) a rapid-acting insulin called mealtime insulin, which is added in the later stages of the disease and injected several times daily approximately 20 to 30 minutes before the ingestion of a meal. Worldwide sales of basal insulin totaled an estimated $11.0 billion in 2019. Several long-acting insulin biosimilars are available in the market today. We expect that the market for basal insulin would further expand in the currently unserved &#8216;pre-diabetic&#8217; market segment if an oral version of basal insulin were available. Clinical research has indicated that early intervention with daily injections of basal insulin could prevent or slow down disease progression in pre-diabetic patients, as steady-state, low levels of insulin would reduce the hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance. Despite this knowledge, pre-diabetic patients currently are not prescribed basal insulin or indeed any injectable as a first-line therapy, and instead are advised lifestyle changes and are prescribed only oral anti-diabetic drugs to manage the disease. However, in market research studies we commissioned, we found that approximately 81% of surveyed endocrinologists would initiate basal insulin therapy for diabetic patients earlier if an oral option were available and 87% of patients using insulin were likely to switch to a once-daily pill if available. Our solution: RT-106 We are developing RT-106, the RaniPill capsule containing our novel formulation of basal insulin, for oral treatment of Type 2 diabetes. We have worldwide commercial rights to RT-106. We intend to pursue partnership opportunities with large pharmaceutical companies to co-develop and commercialize RT-106. We believe that RT-106 would have significant benefit to the millions of people living with Type 2 diabetes who presently inject longer-acting basal insulin daily. Additionally, our RT-106 program aims to address the unserved pre-diabetic patients who would benefit from using basal insulin. Further, because of the solid form of the drug in the RaniPill capsule, generic or rapid acting insulin can be converted to a long-acting formulation using pharmaceutical approaches, enabling additional therapeutic regimen options. Preclinical studies As a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the viability of the RaniPill capsule to deliver insulin orally, we evaluated the efficacy of rapid-acting human insulin delivered via the RaniPill capsule in a preclinical study using anesthetized juvenile swine under a euglycemic glucose clamp. In this study, 20 IU of rapid-acting human insulin was delivered via the RaniPill capsule in one group and via subcutaneous injection in another group, and the associated PK and pharmacodynamic (&#8220;PD&#8221;) profiles compared. Serum samples were taken at frequent intervals over a seven-hour period to quantify serum insulin levels with glucose infusion rates adjusted to maintain plasma glucose levels between 60 and 80 mg\/dl (euglycemic glucose clamp). The changes in glucose infusion rates reflect the glucose disposing action of insulin. Results of this study demonstrate that rapid-acting insulin was successfully delivered via the RaniPill capsule, comparable to subcutaneous injection. The AUC for delivery via RaniPill capsule was 83&#177; 18 and AUC for subcutaneous injection was 81 &#177; 10 pmol\/L.min. Our Regulatory Pathways Test, approval, manufacture, and sale of our products are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations. We, along with our third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory authorities of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. We detail the U.S. regulatory pathway in this section. In the United States, the FDA regulates biologic products such as ours under the FDCA and the PHSA and their implementing regulations. Other jurisdictions will have somewhat different requirements. FDA centers: CDRH, CBER, CDER, OCP Each of our product candidates includes the RaniPill platform and a biologic. The RaniPill platform if marketed without a biologic would be classified by the FDA as a device regulated by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (&#8220;CDRH&#8221;). A biologic if marketed without the RaniPill platform would be classified by the FDA as either a &#8220;biological product&#8221; regulated by the &#160; &#160; Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (&#8220;CBER&#8221;) or a &#8220;drug&#8221; regulated by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (&#8220;CDER&#8221;). The classification as biological product or drug would depend on the FDA&#8217;s definition of &#8220;biological product&#8221; with respect to the active ingredient of a product candidate at the time a request for regulatory license or approval is submitted to the FDA to market that product candidate. The FDA currently defines a biological product as &#8220;a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, protein, or analogous product, or arsphenamine or derivative of arsphenamine (or any other trivalent organic arsenic compound), applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings,&#8221; and defines a protein as an &#8220;alpha amino acid polymer with a specific, defined sequence that is greater than 40 amino acids in size.&#8221; &#160; Because our product candidates each include a device and a biologic, it is expected that each of our product candidates will be classified by the FDA as a combination product. The FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The designation of a lead center generally eliminates the need to receive approvals from more than one center. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the &#8220;primary mode of action&#8221; of the combination product, although the other centers may participate in review. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products, (&#8220;OCP&#8221;), which serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. OCP is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute. It is expected that most of our product candidates will include a biologic within the FDA&#8217;s definition of &#8220;biological product&#8221; and some of our product candidates may include a biologic that will be considered a &#8220;drug.&#8221; CDER is the lead center for review of therapeutic proteins at this time, thus most of our product candidates will have CDER as the lead center. For each product candidate, we will perform numerous preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies, as well as perform human clinical trials. Preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies, and\/or clinical trials may be ongoing concurrently for a product candidate in focused studies to assess various properties of a formulation and\/or the platform of the product candidate. Animal studies require pre-approval by an independent IRB or ethics committee. Human studies in the United States require pre-approval by the FDA. For FDA approval of a human trial, if the trial will involve a biologic alone then an IND application will be needed, and if the trial will involve the RaniPill platform alone then an IDE application will be needed. For a clinical trial in which the RaniPill platform will be used in combination with a biologic, we must submit an IDE application if the lead center is CDRH or an IND application if the lead center is CBER or CDER. IND and IDE applications are discussed in more detail below. Based on discussions with the FDA, we plan to test the RaniPill platform absent a biologic and create a Master File for the platform alone which can be referred to in subsequent FDA submissions. Master file for the RaniPill platform Our RaniPill platform will be used across multiple products and as such, the same device information may be applicable to and used to support multiple submissions to the FDA for our combination products. Based on discussions with the FDA and guidance we have received from CDRH and OCP, we intend to separately evaluate the safety and tolerability of the RaniPill capsule in an IDE study, absent a drug. The IDE study is expected to confirm the safety results already obtained from the various studies we have performed, including repeat-dose GLP studies in canines. The IDE study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the RaniPill capsule in an eight-week healthy volunteer study (n=40) with daily administration of a RaniPill capsule absent a biologic. The study will also evaluate the effect of food on the delivery performance of the RaniPill capsule. After completion of the IDE study, we plan to create a Master File for the RaniPill platform with CDRH. The Master File would include at least facilities and manufacturing procedures and controls, verification and validation reports, biocompatibility test data, GLP canine study data, and IDE clinical trial data. A master file is not itself approved by the FDA, but rather is a mechanism to provide information regarding the device constituent part when the same information is applicable to multiple approval submissions. The information in the RaniPill master file would be applicable to any of our product candidates and could be referenced in our IND, IDE, BLA, or NDA submissions. Approval or license to market the RaniPill capsule The FDA has specified a BLA path for seeking a license to market a biological product and an NDA path for seeking approval to market a drug. It is expected that most of our product candidates will follow the BLA path while some may follow the NDA path. &#160; &#160; Our current pipeline includes well-characterized biologics that have been in clinical use for several years. We believe that we may be able to leverage the FDA&#8217;s prior conclusions of safety, purity, and potency for already-approved products in our own BLA or NDA. The degree to which we may be able to reduce the burden on our own development may depend on whether the API is the same as the original approved product. Additionally, because certain products originally approved under an NDA have been reclassified by the FDA and would now follow a BLA pathway, it is unclear whether conclusions regarding such reclassified products can be leveraged in our BLA submissions. We intend to have the scope of the leverage that will be available from already-approved biologics clarified on a product-by-product basis for each product candidate in pre-IND meetings with the FDA. CBER and CDER may ask for additional testing for specific biologics, disease indications, or patient populations. Additional information regarding regulatory pathways is provided in the &#8220;Government Regulation&#8221; section below. Evaluation Agreements Novartis evaluation agreement In May 2015, we entered into an Evaluation and First Rights Agreement (the &#8220;Novartis Agreement&#8221;), with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis, in which we agreed to perform certain specified research for Novartis to evaluate two specified Novartis compounds with our oral drug delivery technology. In August 2019 and July 2020, we amended the agreement to focus on one compound. Under the agreement, we granted Novartis an exclusive, fully paid-up license to the intellectual property it generates for the sole purpose of delivering that compound via any delivery route other than through use of any microtablet. Novartis will own intellectual property generated related to that compound and we will own all other intellectual property regardless of inventorship. We are currently in the process of completing our own internal testing of higher capacity payloads in the RaniPill capsule. Certain data from such testing was shared with Novartis pursuant to the July 2020 amendment. Following delivery of a report by us, Novartis will have a right of first negotiation to obtain rights to research, develop, manufacture, and commercialize a specified class of biologics formulated with our delivery technology (&#8220;Novartis Field&#8221;) for a period of four months. If we and Novartis do not reach an agreement in this period, for a period of another six months, Novartis will have the opportunity to make a topping bid on any third-party transaction proposal in the Novartis Field. Unless earlier terminated, the Novartis Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire time periods for which Novartis has a right of first negotiation or a right to make a topping bid. Prior to these periods, Novartis may terminate the Novartis Agreement at any time for convenience, and we and Novartis may terminate the Novartis Agreement for the other party&#8217;s uncured material breach. Novartis has paid us an aggregate of $7.0 million under the Novartis Agreement as of December 31, 2021 and made an equity investment of approximately $5 million in our Series C preferred unit financing. As part of the Organizational Transactions, the Series C preferred units were exchanged for 404,638 Paired Interests. We do not expect any future payments under the Novartis Agreement unless we and Novartis negotiate a new agreement constructed around a higher-capacity payload system. Takeda evaluation agreement In November 2017, we entered into an Evaluation and First Rights Agreement (the &#8220;Takeda Agreement&#8221;) with Shire International GmbH, which was subsequently acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (&#8220;Takeda&#8221;). This agreement is now terminated. Changchun High &#38; New Technology Industries evaluation agreement In August 2017, we entered into an Evaluation and Right of First Refusal Agreement, or the CCHN Agreement, with CCHN in which we agreed to perform and share data from preclinical testing of RT-109. We will provide CCHN with reports and data resulting from our performance of our preclinical testing and CCHN will have a non-exclusive right to use this information in connection with specified activities. CCHN will own intellectual property generated under the CCHN Agreement that comprises of or relates to certain materials and assays provided by CCHN and we will own all other intellectual property generated under the CCHN Agreement. Following the completion of the evaluation program, we and CCHN will negotiate, for a period of 90 days, an agreement to provide CCHN with commercial rights for RT-109 in China. Additionally, we granted CCHN a right of first refusal with respect to commercial rights for RT-109 in China for a period of two years following the completion of our preclinical testing, pursuant to which CCHN will have a period of 90 days following our receipt of a third-party proposal for commercial rights for RT-109 in China to make a competing offer for such rights. The CCHN Agreement will expire upon the expiration of CCHN&#8217;s right of first refusal, or up to 90 days longer if CCHN makes a bid under its right of first refusal. Prior to these periods, CCHN may terminate for convenience upon 30 days&#8217; notice, and we and CCHN may terminate for the other party&#8217;s material uncured breach. There are no payment obligations under the CCHN Agreement. &#160; &#160; Manufacturing and Quality Assurance We currently manufacture and assemble RaniPill capsules at our facilities in San Jose and Milpitas, California. We also inspect, package and ship finished products to support our clinical trials from this facility. We are intentionally pursuing a vertically integrated manufacturing strategy, which we believe offers significant advantages, including rapid product iteration, control over our product quality, and the ability to rapidly scale our manufacturing capacity. This capability also allows us to develop future generations of products while maintaining the confidentiality of our intellectual property. Each RaniPill capsule is assembled through a process which involves a series of integrated, well-developed, and highly reproducible steps that have been optimized to consistently produce capsules of high reliability. The RaniPill capsule manufacturing process &#160;A drug API or drug substance combined with excipients specific to the drug API or drug substance is lyophilized and compressed into a solid microtablet form. The microtablet is sealed inside the microneedle and is then packaged in a tiny vial under aseptic conditions. The vial containing the microneedle is incorporated in the RaniPill capsule, which is given a protective coating. Each of these steps in the manufacturing process has been subjected to rigorous testing and process qualification procedures to ensure manufacturing consistency. We rely on non-exclusive, third-party relationships with several manufacturers for the drug API or drug substance. We maintain in-house capabilities related to the aseptic manufacturing, following FDA Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations for drugs that contain minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packing of a drug product (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) guidelines. Our personnel have significant technical, manufacturing, analytical, quality, regulatory, and project management experience to oversee our third-party manufacturers and to manage in-house manufacturing and quality operations in compliance with regulatory requirements. &#160; The current semi-automated manufacturing process will be sufficient to support our currently planned clinical trials. In parallel, we are in the process of automating the entire manufacturing process, which we anticipate being complete by the time the RaniPill capsule is commercialized. Commercialization Markets The key markets for our products, once approved, will be in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Sales and supply infrastructure Development of our product candidates includes identifying sources that can provide consistent quality and increasing quantities of APIs, or drug substance to meet our needs through in vitro studies, preclinical studies, and clinical trials, and later into commercialization. We currently do not have agreements in place for long-term supplies of any API or drug substance. Availability of API or drug substance supply may inform our decisions regarding which product candidates present the best development opportunities. &#160; Currently we do not have any approved products. We intend to either develop the commercialization sales and supply infrastructure as our product candidates are approved, or partner with pharma companies for commercialization. Coverage and reimbursement of approved products by third-party payors Sales of any product, if approved, depend in part on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement, if any, for such product by the payors. Decisions regarding whether to cover a product, the extent of coverage, and the amount of reimbursement to be provided are made separately, and these decisions are made on a plan-by-plan basis because there is no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement. As a result, one payor&#8217;s decision to cover a &#160; &#160; particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product, or that any of the reimbursement rates will be adequate. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage policy, formulary, and reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific, clinical, and\/or cost-effectiveness support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products when available. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging prices charged, examining medical necessity, and reviewing cost effectiveness in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. A decrease in, or decision to stop, payor reimbursement for a product could reduce physician prescribing of, and patient demand for, the product. Competition Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological changes as researchers learn more about diseases and develop new technologies and treatments. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of product candidates we may develop are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of administration, price, and reimbursement. Broadly speaking, we will face competition from current and future (generic or biosimilar) manufacturers of the branded injectable versions of our pipeline drugs, manufacturers such as AbbVie Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Novartis AG, Roche Holdings AG, etc. However, we believe that oral biologics have the potential to take significant market share from current injectable therapies. We also believe that oral biologics have the potential to expand existing markets by an early reach into new patient populations that are averse to taking injections. We are aware of a few companies that are pursuing oral biologics through either device-based or chemistry-based technologies. Early stage device-based technologies such as the SOMA and LUMI from the Novo Nordisk-MIT collaboration were reported to be in preclinical stages several years ago. Chemistry-based oral delivery companies include Oramed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Entera Bio Ltd., Applied Molecular Transport Inc., Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc., i2O, Therapeutics, Progenity, Inc., Intract Pharma, and two with recently approved oral peptide products &#8211; Amryt Pharma ( Mycappssa ) and Novo Nordisk A\/S ( Rybelsus ). Chemistry-based approaches have limited applications because they work only for small peptides and, even then, with low (often less than 1%) bioavailability, far lower than injections. In contrast, our versatile technology is designed to deliver biologics, from small peptides to large proteins, irrespective of molecular mass and with bioavailability similar to that of injections. Environmental impact We have instituted policies and procedures related to appropriate chemical and biological material handling, use, and disposal in our facilities, and we train our employees on these policies and procedures. Regulations in certain jurisdictions may require us to submit with our marketing approval request an environmental impact assessment related to our biologics, our RaniPill platform, or both. Such assessments could cause significant expenditures. We may be able to reduce expenditures related to these assessments by our strategy of using biologics already approved for marketing. Intellectual Property Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection for our current and future product candidates and the technologies used to develop and manufacture them. Our development efforts have enabled us to construct an extensive intellectual property portfolio that we believe provides us a competitive advantage. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position through patents, trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality agreements, and facility and network security measures. Some of our intellectual property is in-licensed. We believe that our intellectual property portfolio provides good coverage for our current and pipeline product candidates. &#160; &#160; For information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212; Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.&#8221; Patents We have built a patent portfolio globally around several aspects of the current and future generations of our technology. We file new patent applications as we conduct research and development, initiate new programs and monitor the activities of others. Generally, issued patents are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional filing date if all fees continue to be paid. In some cases, the term of a United States patent may be shortened by terminal disclaimer, such that its term is reduced to end with that of an earlier-expiring patent. In some cases, U.S. patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of delay by the U.S. Patent &#38; Trademark Office (&#8220;USPTO&#8221;) in examining the patent application (patent term adjustment) or extended to account for term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period (patent term extension), or both. Our initial patent family has a priority date in 2009, with patent term expected to extend into at least 2030 if all fees are paid. This patent family claims many device aspects of the RaniPill capsule, and the delivery of a wide variety of biologics using the RaniPill capsule. Patents and patent applications in this core family number more than 230. As of January 14, 2022, this patent family included 65 patents issued in the United States and 126 patents issued in other jurisdictions (in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom), with applications pending in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, and Japan. Our microtablet patent family includes claims covering the microtablets delivered by the RaniPill capsule. This patent family has a priority date in 2014, includes several dozen patents and patent applications, and is expected to have patent terms extending into at least 2035 if all fees are paid. As of January 14, 2022, this patent family included 8 patents issued in the United States, 2 patents issued in Australia, and 1 patent issued in China, with applications pending in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, and Japan. We own numerous additional patents and patent applications, with claims to additional biologics, pharmacologic properties of various biologics and various next generation devices, with applications pending in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Mexico, and South Korea. Patents in these families are expected to expire between the late 2030s and early 2040s if all fees are paid. Trade secrets and other proprietary information We rely in part on keeping our trade secrets and other proprietary information confidential. We protect proprietary information by executing confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with employees, and consulting or other contractual agreements with consultants, scientific advisors, sponsored researchers, contractors, and other collaborators, prior to commencement of our relationship with them. Confidentiality agreements limit use and disclosure of our confidential information during and after the relationship. Intellectual property assignment agreements require that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived during the period of the relationship are our exclusive property. We take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties. Government Regulation Regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of products such as those we are developing. We, along with our third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory authorities of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. Failure to comply with applicable regulations at any time during the product development process or approval process or after approval may result in delays to the conduct of a study, regulatory review, or commercialization authorization, or may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial actions. In the United States, such actions could include, among other actions, refusal to allow proceeding with clinical trials, imposition of a clinical hold, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license suspension or revocation, issuance of untitled or warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations or penalties. &#160; &#160; Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) To obtain marketing approval for a candidate product, we must finalize processes for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. These processes must address design, monitoring, control, and maintenance of manufacturing processes and facilities, and the implemented processes must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate. Our processes must, among other things, enable us to monitor several aspects of the interim and finished product, such as identity, purity, strength, quality, potency, and sterility as applicable. Additionally, stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life, and appropriate packaging must be selected and tested. Preclinical and clinical development For each product candidate, we perform numerous laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, as well as human clinical trials. Preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies, and\/or clinical trials may be ongoing concurrently for a product candidate in focused studies to assess various properties of a formulation and\/or platform of the product candidate. Animal studies require pre-approval by an independent Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (&#8220;IACUC&#8221;). Human studies in the United States require pre-approval by the FDA and an independent IRB, requested by way of an IDE or IND for investigational products such as our product candidates. &#160; Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP, which includes the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Furthermore, an independent IRB or ethics committee for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and an IRB or ethics committee must monitor the study until completed. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. Regulatory authorities, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, the trial is not being performed in accordance with the investigational plan or associated protocols, or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if the data safety monitoring board determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects, no demonstration of efficacy, or other grounds. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies, clinical trials, and clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three phases that may be performed sequentially, in overlapping time frames, or in combination. &#8226; Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase 1 studies may be conducted in patients or normal volunteer subjects. These studies are designed to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. The total number of subjects and patients included in Phase 1 studies varies with the drug, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. &#8226; Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 studies are typically conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects. &#8226; Phase 3 studies are expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 studies usually include from several hundred to several thousand subjects. For each of our product candidates, we may conduct Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials of our formulation, the RaniPill platform, or the formulation in combination with the RaniPill platform. &#160; &#160; In some cases, the FDA may require, or we may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may alternatively be made a condition to approval of the BLA or NDA. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and further document clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under certain regulatory programs, such as accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for the associated product. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND or IDE safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to a particular or similar biologic, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Investigational products Prior to initiating a clinical trial of an investigational product such as for one of our product candidates, the FDA must grant authorization to proceed. A request for authorization is made by way of an IND or IDE application as applicable for the clinical trial. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocols to be used in associated preclinical studies and clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies already performed to assess toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product. The IND further includes chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information, and human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IDE is a request for authorization from the FDA to allow an investigational device to be used in a clinical trial to collect safety and effectiveness data. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. An IND or IDE must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND or IDE automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND or IDE may be placed on clinical hold to resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA&#8217;s approval of an IND or IDE does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the stated conclusions, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations that govern investigational product labeling, prohibit promotion, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting, and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. Clinical trials must further comply with FDA regulations that govern institutional review board approval, informed consent, and other human subject protections. An amendment to the existing IND or IDE must be made for subsequent protocol changes and also for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Although the FDA Quality System Regulation does not fully apply to investigational products, the requirement for controls on design and development does apply. The sponsor also must manufacture the investigational product in conformity with the quality controls described in the IND or IDE application and any conditions of IND or IDE approval that FDA may impose with respect to manufacturing. BLA\/NDA review process Following completion of clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry, and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the product candidate for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity, and potency for a biological product. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data &#160; &#160; may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product&#8217;s use and\/or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators or cooperative clinical groups. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (&#8220;PDUFA&#8221;) and the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (&#8220;BPCI&#8221;), as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. User fees may be adjusted on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug or biologic. BsUFA imposes a user fee for a biosimilar development program at the time of the first meeting with the FDA or the initial IND submission, whichever occurs first. This fee must be paid annually. The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review and respond to the applicant, or six months if the submission is designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process may be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and\/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies, or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (&#8220;PREA&#8221;), a BLA or NDA submission or supplement must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDCA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, (&#8220;PSP&#8221;), within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints, and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and\/or other clinical development programs. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Expedited development and review programs The FDA has a number of programs intended to expedite the development or review of products that meet certain criteria. For example, presently the FDA has a fast-track designation, a priority review path, an accelerated approval path, and a breakthrough therapy designation. Any product submitted to the FDA for approval may be eligible for one or more of such FDA programs intended &#160; &#160; to expedite development and review. These expedited approvals do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate. &#8226; New drugs may be eligible for fast-track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast-track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast-track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the review team during product development, and the FDA may consider sections of the BLA or NDA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted. &#8226; A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of a BLA or NDA designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of standard review designation under its current PDUFA review goals. &#8226; Products intended to treat serious or life threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, has an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. &#8226; The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category referred to as &#8220;breakthrough therapies.&#8221; A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a &#8220;breakthrough therapy&#8221; if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or may decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Post-approval requirements Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to cGMP, quality controls, record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, including adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each approved product. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. Biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. We are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified contract manufacturers, laboratories, and packagers, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to them. These facilities and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed, or tested by them. Accordingly, we must continue to expend time, money, and effort on quality control for our own facilities and the facilities of others which contribute to the commercialization of our final product, to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or &#160; &#160; clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: &#8226; Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls &#8226; Fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials &#8226; Refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals &#8226; Product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products &#8226; Consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs &#8226; Mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information &#8226; The issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product &#8226; Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety, efficacy, purity, and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product&#8217;s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, one or more of adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, civil penalties, criminal penalties, government investigation, debarment, or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product&#8217;s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine by physicians or their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, regulate manufacturer&#8217;s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. Orange Book; Purple Book The FDA publishes the Orange Book for products following the NDA pathway and the Purple Book for products following the BLA pathway. Our product candidates will be listed in the Orange Book after approval for marketing or listed in the Purple Book after license for marketing, as applicable. The Orange Book contains information about all FDA-approved drug products regulated by CDER and their exclusivities. The Orange Book also includes patent information. The applicant provides patent information to the FDA as part of its NDA, or after patent grant. Orange Book patent listing provides a 30 month stay of FDA approval of any generic submitted via an ANDA. An applicant submitting an ANDA must, for each patent listed against the approved drug in the Orange Book, either (i) state that the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval for a patented method of use, (ii) ask the FDA to delay approval until that patent is expired (a &#8220;Paragraph III&#8221; certification), or (iii) attest that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the generic product (a &#8220;Paragraph IV&#8221; certification), which can trigger ANDA litigation over the associated patent. The purple book contains information about all FDA-licensed biological products regulated by CBER, including licensed biosimilar and interchangeable products and their reference products, and FDA-licensed allergenic, cellular and gene therapy, hematologic, and vaccine products regulated by CBER. The Purple Book includes granted exclusivity information. The Purple Book also includes for each biological product a list of patents identified to a biosimilar applicant during biosimilar litigation under the BPCIA. Exclusivities Some of our product candidates may be eligible for exclusivities provided under various FDA programs. Exclusivity refers to certain delays and prohibitions on approval of competitor drugs available under an applicable statute that take effect upon &#160; &#160; FDA&#8217;s approval of a biologics or drug, or of certain supplements to the BLA or NDA. Exclusivities do not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The Pediatric exclusivity might apply to most or all of our product candidates. For an applicant to be able to take advantage of the Pediatric exclusivity, the FDA must make a written request for a pediatric study to be performed, although the applicant may request for the FDA to make the request for a pediatric study. After the study is performed, the applicant may request Pediatric exclusivity. If granted, 180 days of patent term are added to the patent term listed in the Orange Book. With respect to other FDA exclusivity programs, in some cases the exclusivity programs will not apply to our product candidates due to our unique formulation or oral capsule technology, or it is unclear the extent to which they will apply, or they will not apply to most or all of the product candidates in our pipeline. For exclusivity programs that apply to our product candidates, we will consider pursuing such exclusivities at the appropriate time. However, we do not expect any of the exclusivities to provide us significant competitive advantage. Exclusivities granted to our competitors could block approval and\/or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates, possibly for several years. Other healthcare laws and compliance requirements Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the Sunshine Act, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;), and similar foreign, federal, and state fraud and abuse, transparency, and data privacy and security laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including stock options. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers, among others, on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but they are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. Our activities, including our engagement of consultants, may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending and so may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of an applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all relevant facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, a claim including items or service resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, can result in a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent. For example, the federal False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. The U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of prescription drugs, devices, biological products, or medical supplies subject to FDA approval or clearance for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, including ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. In addition, HIPAA, as amended the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose certain requirements on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, &#160; &#160; healthcare clearinghouses, and health plans, and individuals and entities, known as business associates, that provide services for or on behalf of the covered entities that involve individually identifiable health information as well as their covered subcontractors, relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. We are also subject to additional similar U.S. state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which, in some cases, differ from each other in significant ways, and may not have the same effect, complicating compliance efforts. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties including, without limitation, significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participating in government-funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, government investigations, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and market share, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Healthcare reform The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality, or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the &#8220;ACA&#8221;), which was enacted in March 2010, contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#8217; share of sales to federal health care programs. There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021, the United States Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the &#8220;individual mandate&#8221; was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to additional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA, or the impact any changes to the ACA may have on our ability to commercialize products or the prices we are able to obtain. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional action is taken by Congress. COVID-19 relief legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Further, Congress is considering additional health reform measures. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, &#8220;Promoting Competition in the American Economy,&#8221; with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden&#8217;s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;HHS&#8221;) released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. &#160; &#160; Data privacy and security obligations &#160; In the ordinary course of our business, we may collect, receive, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, share and store (commonly known as processing) proprietary, confidential and sensitive information, including personal data, intellectual property, trade secret, and proprietary information owned or controlled by ourselves or third parties (collectively, sensitive information). We, and the third parties upon whom we rely, use information technology, software and services to process other sensitive information. Accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy and security. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;), the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation 2016\/679 (&#8220;EU GDPR&#8221;) and the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (&#8220;UK GDPR&#8221;). In addition, several states within the United States have enacted or proposed data privacy and security laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act. Obligations related to the processing of personal data worldwide is rapidly evolving. The number and scope of data privacy and security laws, regulations and other obligations is changing, subject to differing applications and interpretations, and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions, or in conflict with other data processing obligations. Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements, including our relationship with our CROs or other vendors who process data on our behalf, comply with applicable data privacy and security obligations will involve substantial costs. Foreign data privacy and security laws (including but not limited to the EU GDPR and UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. For example, the EU GDPR, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification, and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. Additional requirements may include limiting personal data processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal data processing; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal data; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the UK and\/or the EU in certain circumstance. European data protection laws, such as the EU GDPR, also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area. Various data privacy and security laws in the U.S. also impose compliance obligations. For example, the CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures related to a business&#8217;s collection, use, and disclosure of personal data and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal data (for example, requests to know of the business&#8217;s personal data processing activities, to delete the individual&#8217;s personal data, and to opt out of certain personal data disclosures). Also, the CCPA provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for data breaches which may include an award of statutory damages. Although the CCPA exempts certain data processed in the context of clinical trials, the CCPA, to the extent applicable to our business and operations, may increase our compliance costs and potential liability with respect to the personal data we maintain about California residents. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, effective January 1, 2023, will expand the CCPA. The CPRA will, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit the use of certain sensitive personal data, establish restrictions on personal data retention, expand the types of data breaches that are subject to the CCPA&#8217;s private right of action, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law. U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data Employees and Human Capital Resources &#160; As of December 31, 2021, we had 114 full-time employees and no part-time employees. The majority of our employees are based at our facilities in San Jose and Milpitas, California, with a contingent of employees based outside of California. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are a party to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that we have good relations with our employees. Attracting and Retaining Talent &#160; Our human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain, and motivate selected employees, consultants, and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards. In addition, we have added a People Ops team that has launched multiple initiatives focused on employee health and engagement, inter and intra team building and &#160; &#160; collaboration, and individual career development planning. We have implemented a health engagement program that is completed by all new hires. We have also implemented a health engagement check-in for all existing employees. This is all in support and encouragement of a more collaborative environment at the company, which is vital to our efforts to recruit, retain and develop our employees. Compensation and Benefits &#160; The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees. We provide market competitive compensation and benefits programs. In addition to salaries, these programs include potential annual discretionary bonuses, broad-based equity awards, a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave and flexible work schedules, among others. These benefits provide our employees choices where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. COVID-19 and Employee Safety &#160; In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the related guidelines and orders issued by federal, state and local governments, we continue to restrict access to our offices in California, limit work gatherings, and suspend non-essential business travel. Many of our employees are conducting their work remotely, wholly or in part, to reduce the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak in our facilities. We have modified workspaces for employees that are essential to continue to work in the office. The safety, health, and well-being of our employees is paramount. As such, we will consider ongoing government regulations and local health conditions in establishing and implementing workplace practices. Initial Public Offering We became publicly traded in July 2021 through the IPO in which the Company sold 7,666,667 shares of its Class A common stock, including shares issued pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters&#8217; option, for cash consideration of $11.00 per share. We received approximately $73.6 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, offering costs and commissions. We used the proceeds from the IPO to purchase 7,666,667 newly issued economic nonvoting Class A units of Rani LLC. Details regarding the IPO can be found in &#8220; Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements &#8221; below. Capital Structure We have three classes of common stock. Our Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class C common stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. All shares of our Class B common stock are held by certain stockholders who held equity in Rani LLC before the IPO. The shares beneficially owned by the Continuing LLC Owners represent more than 80% of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of March 15, 2022. The Continuing LLC Owners will be able to determine or significantly influence any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. Shares of our Class C common stock are not issued nor outstanding and we have no current plans to issue shares of Class C common stock. These shares will be available to be used in the future to further strategic initiatives, such as financings or acquisitions, or issue future equity awards to our service providers. Because the shares of Class C common stock have no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), the issuance of such shares will not result in further dilution to the voting power held by the Continuing LLC Owners. The multi-class structure of our common stock is intended to ensure that, for the foreseeable future, the Continuing LLC Owners continue to control or significantly influence our governance which we believe will permit us to continue to prioritize our long-term goals rather than short-term results, to enhance the likelihood of stability in the composition of our board of directors and its policies, and to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened acquisition of us.
